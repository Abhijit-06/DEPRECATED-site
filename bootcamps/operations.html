<p>
  The Software Carpentry Bootcamp Operations Guide includes
  checklists for each role involved in running a bootcamp,
  and a long-form description of the story of a bootcamp.
  The description explains how bootcamps work,
  and the checklists explain how each role
  contributes to a successful bootcamp.
  The checklists will also be useful
  to people who have taken on each role.

  <h2>The Story of a Bootcamp</h2>

  <p>
    A Software Carpentry bootcamp is an intensive hands-on workshop
    at which scientists learn software skills
    through short tutorials and practical exercises.
    A typical bootcamp runs over two days with 20-50 attendees and
    two or three instructors per room,
    and one helper for every 10 attendees.
    The members of a bootcamp team are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/host.html">host</a>,
      the principal local contact for the bootcamp.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/instructors.html">instructors</a>, who
      present the tutorials and lead the practical exercises.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/lead_instructor.html">lead instructor</a>,
      is in charge of deciding what will be taught by whom
      and ensuring the teaching aspects of the bootcamp go smoothly.
      Software Carpentry admin decides which instructor will be
      the lead instructor.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/helpers.html">Helpers</a>
      provide assistance during practical sessions,
      update and answer questions on the bootcamp Etherpad,
      and help with various practical matters.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/admin.html">Software Carpentry admin</a>
      advises and helps the host with bootcamp organization,
      matches hosts with instructors,
      sets up registration and assessments,
      etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Learners come to the bootcamp to learn.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Note that:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      One person may have several roles in a bootcamp;
      for example,
      it's common for the host to also be a learner.
    </li>
    <li>
      We require hosts, instructors, and learners to adhere to our
      <a href="{{page.root}}/conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="well" id="bootcamp_definition">
    <h4>What makes a bootcamp a <em>Software Carpentry</em> bootcamp?</h4>
    <p>
      As <a href="{{page.root}}/faq.html#who-can-run-a-bootcamp">explained in our FAQ</a>,
      anyone can use our materials and run a bootcamp.
      However,
      you must have our explicit prior permission
      to use our name and logo
      (which are <a href="{{page.root}}/faq.html#trademark">trademarked</a>).
      We normally require that the lead instructor be certified by Software Carpentry,
      and that the training covers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	task automation (e.g., how to write a simple shell script),
      </li>
      <li>
	modular programming (particularly how and why to break a program into functions),
      </li>
      <li>
	version control (with a focus on recording work done and sharing work with others);
	and
      </li>
      <li>
	unit testing (especially as a way to guide and accelerate development).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

</div>

<div id="early-planning">
  <h2>Early Planning</h2>

  <p>
    Before the bootcamp organization begins,
    the host has to consider the answers
    to a series of questions.
    At some point in this decision-making process,
    the host will contact
    Software Carpentry admin to initiate
    bootcamp planning.
  </p>

  <div id="who-for">
    <h3>Who is the bootcamp for?</h3>
    <p>
      The host must think about the intended audience for the bootcamp.
      Will it be restricted to a specific lab, university, or company?
      Will it target people in a particular discipline
      (or range of related disciplines),
      or will it be open to all?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="host_who">
    <h3>Open or closed? Public or private?</h3>
    <p>
      A closed bootcamp can be more easily restricted to a specific audience,
      which allows the instructors
      to tailor material to that field.
      In addition,
      attendees are more likely to know one another,
      which in our experience means they're less inhibited about asking
      questions
      and are more likely to help each other during practical sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand,
      it may be harder to find enough people to fill a bootcamp if you
      restrict enrollment,
      and if your funding comes from the university or company level,
      it may be politically difficult to turn people away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having said that, there are a number of reasons why you
      might consider allowing
      external personnel to come to your bootcamp:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Others can see how a bootcamp is run and decide
	whether they want to run one too,
	which contributes to the growth and sustainability
	of Software Carpentry.
      </li>
      <li>
	Attendees are given the opportunity to network and build relationships
	with researchers from elsewhere within your institution or community,
	or foster cross-disciplinary collaboration.
      </li>
      <li>
	Your profile is raised within your institution
	or community as one experienced in hosting bootcamps
	which means others may seek your advice when they come to run theirs.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="host_numbers">
    <h3>How many learners?</h3>
    <p>
      Bootcamps work best with rooms of between 15 and 40 learners. Above
      that, they become more like a lecture and the hands-on workshop feeling
      is lost. If you are expecting significantly more than 40 registrants,
      consider hosting a multi-room bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multi-room bootcamps can work very well because they allow us to
      stream learners into groups according to their computing experience.
      The disadvantage, of course, is that you have to book multiple rooms
      and recruit more instructors and helpers.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>What about cost?</h3>
  <p>
    The host needs to think about the cost of running a bootcamp and
    where the money might come from, and apply for funding if necessary.
  </p>

  <div class="well" id="host_cost">
    <h4>The cost of running a bootcamp</h4>
    <p>
      Our instructors are volunteers,
      and do not need to be paid for their time,
      but bootcamp hosts are expected to cover their
      travel and accommodation costs.
      (As much as possible,
      we try to match instructors to nearby sites in order to reduce costs.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We suggest hosting institutions contribute {{site.admin_overhead}}
      to Software Carpentry, to support
      central development activities (including
      curriculum development,
      instructor training,
      website maintenance,
      and administrative costs).
      The hosting site may also have to pay to book the room
      and for catering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether, the total cost for a bootcamp is in the $2500-4000 range,
      depending on instructors' travel costs.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="host_funding">
    <h4>Possible funding sources</h4>
    <p>
      Some possible sources of funding are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	"Miscellaneous" funds
	(e.g., a few thousand dollars in a faculty member's grant).
	This is by far the most common case.
      </li>
      <li>
	Training budgets at the lab, department, or institutional level.
      </li>
      <li>
	Workshop budgets set aside as part of conferences.
      </li>
      <li>
	Charging for registration (typically $20-$40).
	This also reduces the number of no-shows from 20-25% to about 5%.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="host_reducing_costs">
    <h4>How to reduce costs</h4>
    <p>
      The host can consider these
      ways to reduce the costs of running a bootcamp:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Find out if there are others in your
	institution or community who are willing to help with instructor
	travel expenses, room bookings and other costs. They may be willing
	to share costs if their researchers can attend your bootcamp&hellip;
      </li>
      <li>
	&hellip;or just go all-out and agree to run one jointly.
      </li>
      <li>
	Use local instructors and helpers (by local we mean from within your
	institution, region or country) who will have lower travel costs.
      </li>
      <li>
	Co-locate with conferences or workshops being run by your
	institution or within your community.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="host_charge">
    <h3>Should the bootcamp be free to learners?</h3>
    <p>
      The host and admin also need to decide whether the bootcamp is free or not.
      On the one hand, we want bootcamps to be as accessible as possible.
      On the other hand,
      charging $20-$40 for registration cuts the number of no-shows from 20-25% to 5% or less.
      Note that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	If the host decides to charge for registration and keep the revenue
	to defray the cost of catering and other expenses,
	we will still manage registration
	so that we can see how it's going,
	release people from the waiting list,
	access registrant information,
	etc.
      </li>
      <li>
	Be aware that
	as soon as you charge anything at all&mdash;even
	a refundable deposit&mdash;some
	venues will charge for use of the space.
      </li>
      <li>
	Refundable deposits are great in theory,
	but are an administrative nightmare in practice.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="host_when">
    <h3>When should the bootcamp be?</h3>
    <p>
      Many factors determine when to hold a bootcamp.
      The first is obviously the availability of instructors:
      admin will help with this.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the bootcamp will be at a university,
      the start of term works better than the end of term
      (when people are tired, and busy with final assignments and exams),
      and the start of the second (or subsequent) term
      works better for graduate students
      than the start of first term.
      (The start of an academic year is busy anyway,
      and by their second term most students have
      a better idea of their research problem's programming needs.)
      In our experience mid-term breaks and reading weeks
      do <em>not</em> work well:
      bootcamps held then usually have high no-show rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bootcamps can also be scheduled immediately before or after a conference
      (or run as a tutorial within a conference).
      In this case,
      the conference organizers must be involved early and often.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="host_followup">
    <h3>Should there be follow-up sessions?</h3>
    <p>
      The host will decide <em>before</em> the bootcamp
      what kind of follow-up they're going to offer (if any).
      Some groups run weekly lunch-and-learn sessions
      for a couple of months after a bootcamp
      to help people put what they've learned into action.
      Other groups set up mailing lists,
      and we've tried running online tutorials.
      Whatever they decide to do,
      figuring it out in advance means that they can
      tell learners about it at least a couple of times.
    </p>
  </div>

</div>

<div id="initial-organization">
  <h2>Initial Organization</h2>

  <div id="host_instructors">
    <h3>Instructors</h3>
    <p>
      A bootcamp room of approximately 40 people needs at least two
      instructors, and a third is a good idea, because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	It's too much to ask a single person to talk for eight hours a day for two days.
      </li>
      <li>
	Attendees will be more engaged if they hear from more than one person.
      </li>
      <li>
	Having two or three instructors reduces the risk of having to cancel
	because of illness,
	travel mishaps,
	etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Instructors must be recruited <em>before</em> advertising the bootcamp or opening up registration.
      At least one instructor must be certified by Software Carpentry
      in order for the bootcamp to use our name and logo.
      The other instructors should have prior teaching experience,
      be taking the <a href="{{page.root}}/faq.html#how-become-instructor">instructor training</a>,
      or have helped with at least one previous bootcamp.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="admin_list">
    <h3>Mailing list</h3>
    <p>
      Once the bootcamp has a full roster of instructors,
      admin will set up a mailing list for the organizer, instructors,
      and helpers
      so they can discuss audience, content, schedule, dinner plans, etc.
      (This is optional&mdash;some bootcamp teams prefer to
      email back and forth without a mailing list.)
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="host_registration">
    <h3>Registration</h3>
    <p>
      Software Carpentry admin can set up an Eventbrite registration page
      on our Eventbrite account,
      but some sites do use their own system:
      for example,
      bootcamps being run in conjunction with conferences
      may use the conference registration system.
    </p>
    <p>
      If admin sets up an Eventbrite page, we can give the host
      adminstrator permission so they can send messages to registrants,
      download the registrant list, manage the waiting list, etc.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="eventbrite">
    <h4>Setting up Eventbrite</h4>
    <p>
      If the host would like Software Carpentry to run registration through
      Eventbrite, we'll need the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>how many people will be registering</li>
      <li>how much to charge for <a href="#host_charge">registration</a>, if anything</li>
      <li>whether the registration page should be public or private</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Eventbrite events can be public, which means they appear on Google
      and in listings, or private, which means they can only be seen by
      people who have the link. We can also add a password to protect
      the registration page further.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="book_room">
    <h3>The bootcamp venue</h3>
    <p>
      It's the host's job to identify and
      book a suitable room (or rooms)
      for the bootcamp.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="host_venue">
    <h4>Characteristics of a good bootcamp venue</h4>
    <p>
      You'll need a room with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<strong>Front-facing tables</strong>
	so that attendees can watch an instructor and use their laptop at the same time.
	(Typing on a laptop for two days in theater-style seating can cause back strain.)
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>High-speed WiFi or network access</strong>
	that can withstand everyone using it at the same time.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Power outlets</strong>
	for all the computers.
	This often involves extension cords;
	make sure they're taped down.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Space for mingling</strong>
	without squeezing between chairs and tripping over cables.
	This is <em>essential</em>:
	if helpers cannot reach learners who are having problems quickly and easily,
	those learners will fall further and further behind as the day goes on.
	Again,
	theater-style lecture rooms are not recommended
	as their banked floors and fixed seating makes it very difficult for helpers to mingle.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>A microphone</strong>
	if the room is large or has poor acoustics,
	or if the bootcamp will be recorded.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Disabled access.</strong>
	(Make sure the washrooms are accessible as well.)
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Air-conditioning,</strong>
	because all those computers (and attendees) will generate a lot of heat.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Space to serve coffee and snacks</strong>,
	because learning is hungry work.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="admin_webpage">
    <h3>Bootcamp webpage</h3>
    <p>
      The lead instructor and other instructors
      are responsible for creating the bootcamp's home page on GitHub.
      (The <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc">README on the template page</a>
      explains how to do this.)
      The webpage should have
      instructions for attendees,
      including the bootcamp dates, the location,
      a link to the registration page, and so on.
      The host should make sure this page also includes
      local travel information,
      parking instructions,
      and whatever other information is needed.
      After the bootcamp topic list and schedule are finalized,
      they will be posted to the webpage too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Software Carpentry admin will check that the bootcamp is
      showing up properly on
      the <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/index.html">list of upcoming bootcamps</a>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="publicity">
    <h3>Publicity</h3>
    <p>
      Once the webpage is set up,
      the host will start spreading the word about the bootcamp
      using our <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/sample_ad.html">example
	text</a> or something more creative.
      The host can
      tweet and blog about the event,
      and send emails to departmental mailing lists,
      discipline-specific mailing lists,
      specific people (e.g., lab directors or principal investigators),
      and anyone else who may be interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Software Carpentry admin is happy
      to promote the host's blog articles and tweets.
      We'll tweet and blog about the event, too.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="host_catering">
    <h3>Catering</h3>
    <p>
      If it's in the bootcamp budget,
      the host will provide coffee and snacks.
      Doing so cuts the time per coffee break to 10-15 minutes
      from 20-25 minutes.
      If this isn't possible,
      the host should identify somewhere nearby where
      attendees can get refreshments,
      and the schedule should include longer coffee breaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      If snacks will be provided,
      try to allow for allergies and other dietary restrictions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="admin_assessment">
    <h3>The pre-bootcamp assessment</h3>
    <p>
      A few days before the bootcamp begins,
      learners will be asked to complete a
      pre-bootcamp skills assessment, usually as a Google form.
      The responses to the assessment will help the instructors
      tailor the bootcamp material to the group's needs.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="admin_travel">
    <h3>Travel arrangements and reimbursement</h3>
    <p>
      If there is someone at the host institution who usually handles travel
      arrangements, admin or the host will connect them
      with instructors as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host should also make sure it's clear who's paying for what
      and how people will be reimbursed
      <em>before</em> anyone buys plane tickets.
      The hosting site must reimburse instructors directly&mdash;Software
      Carpentry cannot route payments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instructors should not be shy about asking admin
      or the host about how to be reimbursed if they're not sure.
    </p>
  </div>

</div>

<div id="pulling-it-together">

  <h2>Pulling It Together</h2>

  <p>
    Once the initial conversations and setup are done,
    it's time to move forward with the nitty-gritty details
    of running a bootcamp.
  </p>

  <div id="curriculum">
    <h3>Curriculum and Schedule</h3>
    <p>
      The lead instructor, other instructors and host
      will decide what content
      will be covered in the bootcamp.
      The lead instructor will put together
      a schedule of topics
      and assign an instructor to
      each topic.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="equipment">
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to booking a room and catering,
      the host is responsible for providing an assortment of equipment
      and supplies for the bootcamp.
      The host should check that the following equipment and information is
      available <em>and working</em>:
    </p>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>
	A projector (and a spare if you can find one, or a spare bulb if you
	can't).
      </li>
      <li>
	A Mac VGA adapter if anyone is presenting with a Mac.
      </li>
      <li>
	Extension cords and power bars if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
	Two different colors of sticky notes for use as flags and for
	feedback. You'll need enough for each learner to have four of each color
	per day.
	The two colors should be very distict and preferably clearly
	recognizable as "good" and "bad"&mdash;red and green work well
	(but be conscious of color vision deficiencies).
      </li>
      <li>
	Guest usernames and passwords for everyone.
      </li>
      <li>
	If possible, a couple of spare computers with the required software
	already installed, in case someone can't get access to the network,
	forgets their machine, has hardware problems, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
	A handful of USB sticks with installers on them
	just in case there are network problems.
      </li>
      <li>
	Photo release forms (if required).
      </li>
      <li>
	Name badges or stickers for instructors, helpers, and attendees.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="host_helpers">

    <p>
      Helpers keep bootcamps flowing smoothly by assisting learners
      who are having trouble with exercises.  It's the host's responsibility
      to recruit local helpers.
      There should be at least one helper for every ten attendees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of our helpers are scientists who have either gone through a
      previous bootcamp,
      or learned most of what we teach on our own.
      Hosts usually recruit them from the hosting institution
      and nearby institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually, bootcamps don't cover helpers' travel or accommodation expenses.
      Taking the whole team out to dinner the day before the bootcamp starts
      is a nice way to thank everyone and give them a chance to get acquainted.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="waiting_list">
    <h3>Waiting list</h3>
    <p>
      If registration fills up, potential learners can add themselves to the
      waiting list (if the bootcamp is using Eventbrite). A week or two before
      the camp, the host or admin should contact the registered learners
      and confirm that they'll be attending. If anyone cancels and opens
      up a spot, admin or the host should offer that spot to someone
      on the waiting list.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="waitlist_mgmt">
    <h4>Waiting list management in Eventbrite</h4>
    <p>
      Either the host or Software Carpentry admin
      can manage the waiting list.
      There are a couple of tricks to managing Eventbrite
      waiting lists:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	You have to manually release people&mdash;Eventbrite doesn't
	automatically detect that a space has opened up
	and release a ticket.
      </li>
      <li>
	You release tickets by selecting the person's entry on the
	waiting list and clicking "Release Tickets".
	When you release a ticket to someone their name is moved to
	the top of the list and they are sent email letting them know
	they have a day to register. If they don't register within 24 hours,
	the offer times out and the host or admin must
	manually rerelease that ticket.
      </li>
      <li>
	Once the waiting list is activated people cannot register outright,
	even if
	there are spaces available;
	they must add their name to the waiting list
	and have a ticket released to them.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="photo_release">
    <h3>Photo release</h3>
    <p>
      If the bootcamp will be photographed, recorded, or broadcast,
      the host will let learners know by posting on the bootcamp's website.
      Institutions may require the host to obtain a signed photo release
      from each person if pictures are being taken;
      the host is responsible for finding out if a release is required,
      and printing out enough copies.
    </p>
  </div>

</div>

<div id="on-the-day">

  <h2>The Day of the Bootcamp</h2>

  <h4>Introductions</h4>
  <p>
    The host will introduce the instructors and helpers by name, 
    and remind the learners that everyone teaching/helping 
    is volunteering their time, 
    to help set learners expectations.
    The host will talk about why the bootcamp is being held 
    and the desired outcome.  
    They'll also let everyone know where to get coffee,
    whether they can bring drinks and snacks 
    into the bootcamp room,
    and where the bathrooms are.
    The host will also remind learners of the 
    <a href="{{page.root}}/conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.
  </p>
  </div>

  <div id="sign_in">
    <h3>Sign-in sheet and stickies</h3>
    <p>
      Before the bootcamp instruction begins,
      the host will hand out
      sign-in sheets and two different-colored sticky notes
      to each learner.
      The sign-in sheets help us keep track of
      how many learners we are reaching,
      and how successful our efforts to reduce no-shows are.
      The sticky notes let the learners communicate
      with instructors and helpers,
      both during the tutorials and exercises,
      and when giving feedback afterwards.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="feedback">
    <h4>Feedback, or "What are the sticky notes for?"</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
	During demonstrations, learners post a red sticky note
	on their laptop
	to indicate that they have a question or need help.
      </li>
      <li>
	During exercises, learners post a red sticky note
	at the start of the exercise and switch to
	a green one when they finish, so the instructor can
	clearly see when everyone is ready to continue,
	and helpers can see who needs support.
      </li>
      <li>
	Just before each break,
	the instructor will ask learners to write down
	one good point
	(something they learned or enjoyed)
	on their green sticky
	and one bad one
	(something that they still don't understand
	or that is bothering them)
	on their red sticky.
	It only takes a couple of minutes for the instructors
	to sort through these,
	and it tells them whether they're
	going too fast or too slow,
	what they need to review after the break,
	etc.
	(If possible, someone will mail the sticky notes to
	Software Carpentry admin
	after the bootcamp
	so we can look for patterns.)
      </li>
      <li>
	At the very end of the bootcamp,
	the host or lead instructor can ask learners to
	give one good point or one bad one
	about the entire bootcamp.
	This can be done on the sticky notes, the Etherpad, or
	through a Google form.
	(This feedback will also be sent to Software Carpentry admin.)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="flow">
    <h3>Bootcamp flow</h3>
    <p>
      Once the bootcamp starts in earnest, the day will alternate between
      the instructor describing and demonstrating concepts and tools,
      and the learners
      completing short exercises. Sometimes the learners will type along
      as the instructor demonstrates. Learners are encouraged to work
      in pairs and groups, and to mix up their groups over the course of
      the bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instructor will ask lots of questions and encourage the learners
      to ask questions too. No more than ten or fifteen minutes will go by
      without the instructor engaging the learners or asking them to
      complete an exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helpers walk around the room looking out for learners who are
      confused or stuck with an exercise, or who have gotten behind the
      flow of the demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, there is an Etherpad open where all the learners and
      helpers are invited to take notes, post links and examples, and
      ask and answer questions. (This is a great opportunity for learners
      and helpers who aren't so gregarious to participate more
      fully in the bootcamp.)
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="post_assessment">
    <h3>Post-bootcamp assessment</h3>
    <p>
      Before the bootcamp ends, the host or an instructor will direct
      the learners to a post-bootcamp assessment. This is very much like
      the pre-bootcamp assessment, and helps us establish
      how well our bootcamps
      actually work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that we match the pre- and post-bootcamp assessments answers
      using email addresses, so learners should use the same address when
      answering both surveys.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have plans to ultimately send a third assessment a few months
      after the bootcamp, to see how well and how long learners'
      new knowledge and skills stick around.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="parting_words">
    <h3>Parting words</h3>
    <p>
      At the end of the bootcamp, the host or an instructor
      will give the learners some
      final pieces of information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	how to get more help with the things they have learned;
      </li>
      <li>
	how to get involved with Software Carpentry
	by <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/training.html">hosting or teaching a bootcamp</a>,
	<a href="{{page.root}}/pages/discuss.html">joining our discussions</a>,
	or helping us <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/create.html">create material</a>;
	and
      </li>
      <li>
	how to participate in any follow-up sessions the host is planning.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

</div>

<div id="after">

  <h2>After the Bootcamp</h2>

  <div id="host_report">
    <h3>Report back</h3>
    <p>
      Once the bootcamp is over,
      the host will send the following information
      to Software Carpentry admin:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	the number of attendees
      </li>
      <li>names and email addresses of attendees, for our internal database
	and so we can invite them to join our announcements mailing list
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The host will also let admin know how the bootcamp went.
      Was it the right content?
      The right pace?
      Did it seem well organized
      or were there things we could improve?
      What did you hear from learners afterward,
      and would you like us to visit you again?
    </p>
    <p>
      We're also happy to hear from the instructors, helpers,
      and learners with comments
      and suggestions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="blog_post">
    <h3>Blog posts</h3>
    <p>
      Our goal at Software Carpentry
      is to have at least one blog post
      from each bootcamp,
      whether it's written by the host,
      an instructor,
      a helper
      or a learner.
      So if you've been involved in a bootcamp
      and you'd like to write a blog post,
      or if you have written one on your blog,
      let us know so we can post it or link to it.

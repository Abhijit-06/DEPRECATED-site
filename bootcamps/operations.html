<p>
The Software Carpentry Bootcamp Operations Guide includes 
checklists for each role involved in running a bootcamp, 
and a long-form description of the lifecycle of a bootcamp. 
Read the description to understand how bootcamps work, 
and read the checklists to understand how each role 
contributes to a successful bootcamp. 
And, of course, the checklists will be useful
to people who have taken on each role.

<h2>The Story of a Bootcamp</h2>

<p>
  A bootcamp is an intensive hands-on workshop
  at which scientists learn software skills
  through short tutorials and practical exercises.
  A typical bootcamp runs over two days with 20-50 attendees,
  two or three instructors per room,
  and one helper for every 10 attendees.
  The members of a bootcamp team are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <a href="checklists/host.html">host</a> is
    the principal local contact for the bootcamp.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a href="checklists/instructors.html">instructors</a>
    give the lectures and lead the practical exercises.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a href="checklists/lead_instructor.html">lead instructor</a>,
    who is chosen by Software Carpentry admin,
    is in charge of deciding what will be taught by whom 
    and ensuring the teaching aspects of the bootcamp go smoothly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="checklists/helpers.html">Helpers</a> 
    provide assistance during practical sessions, 
    update and answer questions on the bootcamp Etherpad, 
    and help with various practical matters.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="checklists/admin.html">Software Carpentry admin</a>
    advises and helps the host with bootcamp organization,
    matches hosts with instructors,
    sets up registration and assessments,
    etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Learners come to the bootcamp to learn.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Note that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    One person may have several roles in a bootcamp;
    for example,
    it's common for the host to also be a learner.
  </li>
  <li>
    We require hosts, instructors, and learners to adhere to our
    <a href="{{page.root}}/conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="well" id="bootcamp_definition">
  <h4>What Makes a Software Carpentry Bootcamp?</h4>
  <p>
    As <a href="{{page.root}}/faq.html#who-can-run-a-bootcamp">explained in our
      FAQ</a>,
    anyone can use our materials and run a bootcamp.
    However,
    if you want to use our name and logo (which are trademarked),
    the lead instructor must be certified by Software Carpentry
    and the following topics must be covered:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      using the shell to automate tasks
      </li>
      <li>
      programming basics
      </li>
      <li>
      unit testing
      </li>
      <li>
      version control
      </li>
    </ul>
</div>

  <h3>Early Planning</h3>

  <p>
  Before the bootcamp organization begins, 
  the host and admin 
  must make a series of decisions about the bootcamp.
  </p>

    <h4>Who is the bootcamp for?</h4>

    <p>
      The host must think about the intended audience for the bootcamp.
      Is it restricted to a specific lab, university, or company?
      Will it target people in a particular discipline
      (or range of related disciplines),
      or will it be open to all?
    </p>

    <div id="host_who">
      <h4>Open or closed? Public or private?</h4>
  
      <p>
        A closed bootcamp can be more easily tailored to a specific audience.
        In addition,
        attendees are more likely to know one another,
        which in our experience means they're less inhibited about asking
        questions
        and are more likely to help each other during practical sessions.
        On the other hand,
        it may be harder to find enough people to fill a bootcamp if you
        restrict enrollment,
        and if your funding comes from the university or company level,
        it may be politically difficult to turn people away.
      </p>
      <p>
      Having said that, there are a number of reasons why you 
      might want to consider allowing
      external personnel to come to your bootcamp.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
          Others can see how a bootcamp is run and so decide 
          whether they want to run one too,
          which contributes to the growth and sustainability 
          of Software Carpentry.
	</li>
	<li>
          Attendees are given the opportunity to network and build relationships
	  with researchers from elsewhere within your institution or community,
	  or foster cross-disciplinary collaboration.
	</li>
	<li>
          Your profile is raised within your institution 
          or community as one experienced in hosting bootcamps
	  which means others may seek your advice when they come to run theirs.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="host_followup">
      <h4>Follow-up</h4>
  
      <p>
        The host will decide <em>before</em> the bootcamp
        what kind of follow-up they're going to offer (if any).
        Some groups run weekly lunch-and-learn sessions 
        for a couple of months after a bootcamp
        to help people put what they've learned into action.
        Other groups set up mailing lists,
        and we've tried running online tutorials.
        Whatever they decide to do,
        figuring it out in advance means that they can 
        tell learners about it at least a couple of times.
      </p>
    </div>


  <p>
  The host also needs to think about the cost of running a bootcamp and
  where the money might come from, and apply for funding if necessary.
  </p>

  <div class="well" id="host_cost">
    <h4>The Cost of Running a Bootcamp</h4>
  
    <p>
      Our instructors are volunteers,
      and do not need to be paid for their time,
      but bootcamp hosts are expected to cover their 
      travel and accommodation costs.
      (As much as possible,
      we try to match instructors to nearby sites in order to reduce costs.)
      </p>
      <p>
      We also ask hosts to contribute {{site.admin_overhead}} 
      per bootcamp toward central overheads 
      (including curriculum development,
      instructor training,
      website maintenance,
      and administrative costs). 
      The hosting site may also have to pay to book the room
      and for catering.
      </p>
      <p>
      Altogether, the total cost for a bootcamp is in the $2500-4000 range,
      depending on instructors' travel costs.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="host_funding">

    <h3>Possible Funding Sources</h3>

    <p>
      Some possible sources of funding are:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>
        "Miscellaneous" funds
        (e.g., a couple of thousand dollars in a faculty member's grant).
        This is by far the most common case.
      </li>
      <li>
        Training budgets at the lab, department, or institutional level.
      </li>
      <li>
        Workshop budgets set aside as part of conferences.
      </li>
      <li>
          Charging a fee to participants, either when they register 
          or at the door.
      </li>

    </ul>
  
    <p>
      The host may also want to consider these
      ways to reduce the costs of running your bootcamp:</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use your professional network to see if there are others in your
        institution or community who are willing to help with instructor
        travel expenses, room bookings or other costs. They may be willing
        to share costs if their researchers can attend your bootcamp&hellip;
      </li>
      <li>
        &hellip;or just go all-out and agree to run one jointly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use local instructors and helpers (by local we mean from within your
        institution, region or country) who will have lower travel costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Co-locate with conferences or workshops being run by your 
        institution or within your community.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>


    <h4 id="host_charge">Should the bootcamp be free?</h4>
  
      <p>
        The host and admin also need to decide 
        whether the bootcamp is free or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        A $40 fee is an effective way of raising the $1500 Software
        Carpentry bootcamp administration fee, and reduces the 
        the number of no-shows from 20-25% to 5% or less. Other options include:
      </p>
        <ul>
            <li>charging a smaller fee and writing us a check to cover the
            difference;</li>
            <li>charging a refundable deposit (refunded to everyone who attends
                both days), which reduces the no-show rate while still
                effectively providing a bootcamp which is free to learners;</li>
            <li>not charging at all and paying the $1500 admin fee directly</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        If you decide to charge a fee and keep the revenue 
        to defray the cost of catering and other expenses, 
        we ask you to handle registration yourself.
      </p>
            
    <p>
        Be aware that 
        as soon as you charge anything at all&mdash;even a refundable deposit&mdash;some
        venues will charge <em>you</em> for use of the space.
      </p>

  <div class="well">
    <h3 id="host_when">When should I hold my bootcamp?</h3>
  
    <p>
      Many factors determine when to hold your bootcamp.
      The first is obviously the availability of instructors:
      admin will help you with this.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      If you hold the bootcamp at a university,
      keep in mind that the start of term works better than the end of term
      (when people are tired, and busy with final assignments and exams),
      and that the start of the second (or subsequent) term works better for graduate students
      than the start of first term.
      (The start of an academic year is busy anyway,
      and by their second term most students have a better idea of their research problem's programming needs.)
      In our experience mid-term breaks and reading weeks do <em>not</em> work well:
      bootcamps held then usually have high no-show rates.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      You could also schedule a bootcamp immediately before or after a conference
      (or run it as a tutorial within a conference).
      If you do this,
      involve the conference organizers early and often.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="well" id="host_numbers">
      <h3>How Many Learners?</h3>

      <p>
      Bootcamps work best with rooms of between 15 and 40 learners. Above
      that, they become more like a lecture and the hands-on workshop feeling
      is lost. If you are expecting significantly more than 40 registrants,
      consider hosting a multi-room bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p>
      Multi-room bootcamps can work very well because they allow us to 
      stream learners into groups according to their computing experience.
      The disadvantage, of course, is that you have to book multiple rooms
      and recruit more instructors and helpers.
      </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3 id="host_venue">Characteristics of a Good Bootcamp Venue</h3>
  
    <p>
      You'll need a room with:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Front-facing tables</strong>
        so that attendees can watch an instructor and use their laptop at the same time.
        (Typing on a laptop for two days in theater-style seating can cause back strain.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>High-speed WiFi or network access</strong>
        that can withstand everyone using it at the same time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Power outlets</strong>
        for all the computers.
        This often involves extension cords;
        if you're doing that,
        make sure they're taped down.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Space for mingling</strong>
        without squeezing between chairs and tripping over cables.
        This is <em>essential</em>:
        if helpers cannot reach learners who are having problems quickly and easily,
        those learners will fall further and further behind as the day goes on.
        Again,
        theater-style lecture rooms are not recommended
        as their banked floors and fixed seating makes it very difficult for helpers to mingle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A microphone</strong>
        if the room is large or has poor acoustics,
        or if you are recording the lesson.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Disabled access.</strong>
        (Make sure the washrooms are accessible as well&hellip;)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Air-conditioning,</strong>
        because all those computers (and attendees) will generate a lot of heat.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Space to serve coffee and snacks</strong>,
	because learning is hungry work.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3 id="host_registration">Set up registration</h3>

    <p>
      Software Carpentry admin can set up an Eventbrite registration page
      on our Eventbrite account,
      but some sites do use their own system:
      for example,
      bootcamps being run in conjunction with conferences
      may use the conference registration system.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would like Software Carpentry to run registration through
      Eventbrite, we'll need the following information:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>how many people will be registering</li>
          <li>how much you are <a href="#host_charge">charging</a> for the boot
          camp, if anything</li>
          <li>whether the registration page should be public or private</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Eventbrite events can be public, which means they appear on Google
        and in listings, or private, which means they can only be seen by
        people who have the link. We can also add a password to protect
        the registration page further.
    </p>
      

  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3 id="host_helpers">Recruit helpers</h3>
  
    <p>
      Most of our helpers are scientists who have either gone through a
      previous bootcamp,
      or learned most of what we teach on our own.
      Hosts usually recruit them locally from the hosting site 
      and nearby institutions.
      There should be at least one helper for every ten attendees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most bootcamps don't cover helpers' travel or accommodation expenses.
      Taking the whole team out to dinner the day before the bootcamp starts
      is a nice way to thank everyone and give them a chance to get acquainted.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Advertise</h3>
  
    <p>
      The <a href="#lead">lead instructor</a> for the bootcamp
      will create a web page with instructions for attendees,
      including the bootcamp dates, the location, 
      a link to the registration page, and so on.
      It should also include local travel information,
      parking instructions,
      and whatever other information is needed.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Once this page is set up,
      the host should start spreading the word about the bootcamp. 
      <!-- FIXME Add link to sample_ad here. --> 
      admin can provide advice on how to do this,
      and are happy to publish your blog articles and tweets.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      If the bootcamp will be photographed, recorded, or broadcast,
      that information will be posted on the website.
      Institutions may require the host to obtain a signed photo release
      from each person if pictures are being taken.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The host and admin will 
      tweet and blog about the event, 
      and the host can send emails to departmental mailing lists,
      discipline-specific mailing lists,
      specific people (e.g., lab directors or principal investigators),
      and anyone else who may be interested.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3 id="host_catering">Arrange catering</h3>
  
    <p>
      If it is in the bootcamp budget, the host will provide coffee and
      snacks.
      Doing so cuts the time per coffee break to 10-15 minutes 
      from 20-25 minutes.
      If this isn't possible,
      there should be somewhere nearby where attendees can get refreshments,
      and the schedule should include longer coffee breaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are providing snacks,
      try to allow for allergies and other dietary restrictions.
      Please also make sure attendees have been told
      whether they can bring drinks and snacks into the room being used for the class.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3 id="host_report">Report back</h3>
  
    <p>
      Once the bootcamp is over,
      the host will send feedback to admin
      about how it went.
      Was it the right content?
      The right pace?
      Did it seem well organized,
      or were there things we could improve?
      What did you hear from learners afterward,
      and would you like us to visit you again?
    </p>
  
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="hosts_pitfalls">

    <h3>Pitfalls for Hosts</h3>

    <p>
    Organizing a good bootcamp is not trivial, 
    and there are a few pitfalls to avoid.
    </p>

    <dt>Don't underestimate setup requirements</dt>  
    <dd>
      <p>
	Do you have enough power outlets?  (Are you sure?)
	Do you have enough bandwidth to handle fifty people hitting your version control repository at the same time?  (How do you know?)
	Can everyone actually log in?
	Does campus security know you're using the room over the weekend?
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dl>
    <dt>Don't let your learners ignore each other.</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
      Software Carpentry bootcamps are a great networking opportunity
      for our learners (and for us, too).
      Get to know your learners by name,
      have them work in pairs, and get them to mix up the pairs
      at least a couple of times.
        Encourage them to chat to one another at coffee breaks and lunch,
        and to get a pizza or some curry together for dinner on the first day.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Don't Underestimate The Potential for Mishaps</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
      Something always fails to install for someone (or they fail to install
      anything at all), or a bunch of learners are accidentally locked out of
      the building after lunch, or whoever was supposed to drop off power bars
      didn't.  Roll with it, and remember to laugh (even if it's a bit
      hysterically).

    </dd>
    </dl>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="instructors_pitfalls">

    <h3 id="instructors_pitfalls">Pitfalls for Instructors</h4>

    <p>
      Instructing at a bootcamp isn't trivial, either.
      The most important thing is to remember that
      no lesson plan survives contact with the audience.
      Whether it's the network going down
      or the sudden realization that many of your learners
      <em>don't</em> know how to use SSH,
      you will frequently need to improvise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even without hiccups like those,
      try your best to adjust your pace and examples based on
      learners' questions, puzzled looks, and sighs of impatience.
    </p>
    
    <dl>

      <dt>Allow enough time for setup</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          In almost all cases,
          learners want to use their own laptops during bootcamps
          so that they leave with a working environment set up.
          Even if you ask attendees to prepare beforehand,
          and give them detailed instructions,
          some will not have time, 
          or will have run into problems that they're not yet able to fix.
          You should therefore schedule at least 20 minutes for
          <em>checking the learners' machines</em>
          at the beginning of the first day.
          Some bootcamps start early on the first day to allow time to
          troubleshoot setup problems.
        </p>
        </dd>
    <dt>Don't ignore your learners</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        You're not there to reproduce one of our online videos in person:
        you're there to interact with people so that they get a
        better learning experience.
        You shouldn't ever go more than two or three minutes without
        asking a question (and listening to the answer),
        and if it has been 15 minutes since any of your learners asked one,
        odds are you've either lost them or are boring them.
    </dd>

    <dt>Don't bore your learners</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Your audience will never care more about what you're teaching 
        than you appear to,
        so if they get the feeling you're not interested in it,
	they won't be either.
	This does <em>not</em> mean you have to shout,
	crack three jokes a minute,
	or harangue them about how this stuff is really, really important,
	but you do owe it to your audience to show up mentally as well as physically.

        The more time folks spend with their hands on the keyboards 
        doing exercises,
	the more time they're actually paying attention.
	The students have their computers in front of them:
        if you talk for more than five minutes without asking them to 
        use their computers, they'll do so anyway&mdash;on Facebook.

        The feedback you get from learners on sticky notes or through
        surveys is pointless if you don't pay attention to it 
        (or worse, if you explain it away).
        There's no point collecting feedback 
        during and after each bootcamp 
        if you don't change what and how you teach to reflect it.

    <dt>Tell learners "why".</dt>  
    <dd>
      <p>
	Most of our learners are graduate students in science and engineering,
        so they know what evidence looks like, 
        and why working practices should be evidence-based.
        That doesn't mean you have to have the whole of 
        empirical software engineering at your fingertips,
	but please do read
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Facts-Fallacies-Software-Engineering-Robert/dp/0321117425/"><cite>Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering</cite></a>
	and sprinkle a few of the findings it quotes into your lessons.

    <dd>
      <p>
	The things we teach reinforce each other,
	so tie them together at every opportunity.
	Point out that connecting things with pipes in the shell is like chaining functions together,
	or that they can use a shell script to re-run a bunch of different tests before committing to version control,
	and so on.
	If possible, take 15 minutes or so each day to show them how you use these tools in your day-to-day work.

    <h3 id="instructors_practices">Good instruction practices</h3>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>
        If you are using multiple windows (e.g., a command window and an editor window)
        make sure they are both large enough to be visible by all attendees.
        Remember to pause when switching from one window to the other
        so that learners don't become confused.
        If possible,
        use different background colors for different text windows
        to make it easier for learners to tell them apart
        (but keep in mind red-green and blue-yellow color blindness).
      </li>
      <li>
        As you type at the command line,
        read out what you're typing.
        Remember that most learners can only go half as fast as you,
        because they have to watch you type,
        then type it all in again themselves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use Etherpad to share small data sets, snippets of code, and commands with learners.
      </li>
      <li>
      Encourage learners to take notes 
      in the Etherpad.
        This reduces the effort per learner,
        gives you a chance to see what they think you're saying,
        and provides a record after the bootcamp of what was actually taught.
      </li>
      <li>
        Back up the material with your own anecdotes, experiences and evidence&mdash;it
        makes you more credible,
        helps learners understand how to apply what you're teaching to their own problems,
        and prevents the lectures from becoming too dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Emphasise that good software development skills contribute to productive, reproducible, reusable research.
      </li>
      <li>
        For every question with a binary answer (yes/no, have done/have not done, works/does not work),
        ask learners to hold up green (yes) or red (no) sticky notes
        to help you gauge their level of understanding.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you ask attendees to do a practical exercise,
        have them post a red note on their laptop if they run into trouble
        and a green one when they have a solution.
        This lets you gauge how learners are progressing,
        and lets helpers see who needs their assistance.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  


  
  <div class="well">
    <h3>Getting Feedback</h3>
    <ul>
      <li id="lead_stickies">
        Just before each break,
        an instructor will ask learners to write down one good point 
        on their green sticky
        and one bad one on their red sticky
        and hand them in.
        It only takes a couple of minutes to sort through these,
        and it quickly tells instructors whether they're 
        going too fast or too slow,
        whether they need to review some material after the break,
        etc.
        If possible, someone will mail the sticky notes to 
        admin
        so they can look for patterns.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the end of the bootcamp,
        the host or lead instructor will ask learners to 
        give one good point or one bad one
        without repeating anything someone else has already said.
        This feedback will also be sent to Software Carpentry admin.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>More about feedback</h4>
      <p>
	You can't optimize without feedback, so:
      </p>
      <ul class="checklist">
	<li>
        Give learners red and green sticky notes so 
        they can put up a green one when they've finished an exercise,
	  and a red one when they have a question or need setup help.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Have learners write down good and bad points before each break
	  so you can tell right away what you're doing right and wrong.
	</li>
	<li>
        Make sure to leave at least 20 minutes at the 
        end of the final day for feedback
	  (whether it's a verbal "one good/one bad" report,
	  filling in an online survey,
	  or whatever else you're using).
	</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
	And remember: feedback is pointless if you don't pay attention to it (or worse, if you explain it away).
	There's no point collecting feedback after each bootcamp if you don't change what and how you teach to reflect it.

  <h3 id="host_instructors">Find instructors</h3>
  
    <p>
      A bootcamp room of approximately 40 people needs at least two
      instructors, and a third is a good idea, because:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>
	It's too much to ask a single person to talk for eight hours a day for two days.
      </li>
      <li>
	Attendees will be more engaged if they hear from more than one person.
      </li>
      <li>
	Having two or three instructors reduces the risk of having to cancel
	because of illness,
	travel mishaps,
	etc.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Instructors must be recruited <em>before</em> advertising the bootcamp or opening up registration.
      At least one instructor must be certified by Software Carpentry
      in order for the bootcamp to use our name and logo.
      The other instructors should have prior teaching experience,
      be taking the <a href="{{page.root}}/faq.html#how-become-instructor">instructor training</a>,
      or have helped with at least one previous bootcamp.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3 id="admin_travel">Travel arrangements and reimbursement</h3>
  
    <p>
    If there is someone at the host institution who regularly handles travel
    arrangements, admin or the host should connect them
    with instructors as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host should also make sure it's clear who's paying for what
      and how people will be reimbursed
      <em>before</em> anyone buys plane tickets.
      The hosting site must reimburse instructors directly
      &mdash; Software Carpentry cannot route payments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instructors should not be shy about asking admin 
      or the host about how to be reimbursed if they're not sure.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3 id="admin_website">Web Site</h3>
  
    <p>
      The <a href="#lead">lead instructor</a> and other instructors
      are responsible for creating the bootcamp's home page on GitHub.
      (The <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc">instructions on creating bootcamp pages</a>
      explain how to do this.)
      Admin should check that the bootcamp is showing up properly on
      the <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/index.html">bootcamp index page</a>.
      Once the bootcamp page is set up,
      Software Carpentry admin will tweet and blog about the event.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="admin_list">
    <h3>Set up a mailing list</h3>
  
    <p>
      Admin will set up a mailing list for organizers, lecturers, and helpers
      so they can discuss audience, content, schedule, etc.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well" id="admin_assessment">
    <h3>Set up the pre-bootcamp assessment</h3>
    <p>
      Bootcamp participants are asked to complete a pre-bootcamp skills
      assessment and a post-bootcamp assessment. 
      The responses to the assessments help the instructors
      tailor the bootcamp material to the group, and they also help us
      figure out if how we're teaching actually works.
    </p>
  </div>


  <div class="well">
    <h3 id="host_equipment">Everything You Need</h3>
    <p>The host should check that the following equipment and information is
    available <em>and working</em>:</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>
        A projector (and a spare if you can find one, or a spare bulb if you
        can't).
      </li>
      <li>
        A Mac VGA adapter if anyone is presenting with a Mac.
      </li>
      <li>
        Extension cords and power bars if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
      Two different colors of sticky notes for use as flags and for
      feedback. You'll need enough for each learner to have four of each color
      per day.
      </li>
      <li>
        Guest usernames and passwords for everyone.
      </li>
      <li>
        If possible, a couple of spare computers with the required already
        installed software in case someone can't get access to the network,
        forgets their machine, has hardware problems, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
	A handful of USB sticks with installers on them
	just in case there are network problems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Photo release forms (if required).
      </li>
      <li>
        Name badges or stickers for instructors, helpers, and attendees.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

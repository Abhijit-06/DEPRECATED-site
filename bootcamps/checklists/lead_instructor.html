title: Bootcamp Checklist &mdash; Lead Instructor
---
<p>
  Along with the
  <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/instructors.html">usual duties of an instructor</a>,
  lead instructors are responsible
  for leading discussions among the instructors and host about what to teach
  and who's teaching what.
  They are also responsible for making sure that
  the bootcamp's web page and repository are set up in good time,
  and for handling evaluation.
</p>

<p>
  All of these duties can be delegated,
  but it's the lead instructor's responsibility to make sure they are done.
  If you've been assigned the lead instructor role 
  but aren't comfortable with it,
  or find that you don't have time,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">let Software Carpentry admin know</a>
  as soon as possible.
</p>

  <h4>Initial Preparation</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Create the
      <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc">GitHub repository</a>
      that will host the bootcamp's web pages.
    </li>
    <li>
      Talk to the boot camp host about the boot camp audience
      and their desired curriculum and level.
      Talk to the bootcamp host about the audience;
      what field(s) are they from, 
      and what is their expertise level,
      and what curriculum would interest them?
    </li>
    <li>
      With the other instructors, decide:
      <ul>
        <li>what content to cover,</li>
        <li>what the schedule will be, and</li>
        <li>who will teach what.</li>
      </ul>
      This usually takes a few iterations, so don't leave it until the last minute.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create a schedule for your bootcamp
      with instructors' names against each topic being taught.
      Be sure to allow enough 
      time to set up
      on the first day,
      and for learners to fill in the post-bootcamp assessment on the last day.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create the home page for the bootcamp in that repository,
      and either write or recycle a description of the curriculum
      and setup instructions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create an Etherpad for the bootcamp.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you're local to the bootcamp site,
      suggest some helpers if you can.
    </li>
    <li>
      Consult the 
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/instructors.html">instructors' checklist</a>:
      all of those tasks apply to the lead instructor too.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>A Week or Two Before</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Send a reminder email to attendees about installing software,</strong>
      and offer to help people who are having problems.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure the pre-bootcamp assessment questionnaire has been created
      and sent to your learners,
      and share the responses with your fellow instructors.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure all the instructors have posted their materials
      on the bootcamp web site.
    </li>
    <li>
      If possible, introduce yourself to the helpers;
      give them the link to the bootcamp webpage
      and ask them to follow the setup instructions;
      and ask them to arrive at least 15 minutes earlier than learners.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
  
<div class="well">
  <h4>First-Day Welcome</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Remind everyone of the <a href="{{page.root}}/conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure all learners are set up correctly and have sticky notes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remind learners of the bootcamp's goals and schedule.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remind helpers to mingle and encourage conversation
      as well as answer questions and debug setup problems.
    </li>
    <li>
      As learners arrive,
      ask them to connect to the network
      and check that they have software installed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Circulate the sign-in sheet and photo release form.
    </li>
    <li>
      Distribute colored sticky notes to learners.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>During the Boot Camp</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Before each break,
      have learners 
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#feedback">submit feedback</a>
      on their sticky notes. 
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
  
<div class="well">
  <h4>At the End</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ask for feedback (one good thing and one bad thing) 
      and send it to Software Carpentry.
      You can collect it on sticky notes,
      on the Etherpad,
      or in a plain text file.
    </li>
    <li>
      Distribute the post-bootcamp assessment.
      It's best if learners complete it before they leave.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss why assessment is important for Software Carpentry and for participants
      (quantitatively show and measure impact,
      better funding, 
      ways boot-camps can improve for the future).
    </li>
    <li>
      Let participants know 
      they will be asked to volunteer 
      for impact study interview in 3 months. 
      Very few people have been volunteering 
      so their participation is very important.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>After</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Fill in the workshop summary questionnaire
      to let the Software Carpentry admin know
      what was actually taught and how it went.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

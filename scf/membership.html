<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>An <em>internal</em> workshop is one whose audience is mainly from the host organization (e.g., a workshop run by the University of Melbourne for staff and students of the University of Melbourne).</p></li>
<li><p>An <em>external</em> workshop is one whose audience is mainly for people not at or from the host organization (e.g., a workshop organized by the University of Melbourne but run at the University of Wollongong).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Coordinating</em> a workshop means handling the administration involved in lining up instructors, administering assessment questionnaires, providing information on attendees to the SCF, etc. Staff working for the organizer do not necessarily teach the workshop.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hosting</em> a workshop means providing space for it, supporting travel costs for instructors (if applicable), etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>administration fee</em> is the fee the SCF charges per workshop to support curriculum development, instructor training, and central administrative costs. The amount is specified in the current version of the workshop guidelines.</p></li>

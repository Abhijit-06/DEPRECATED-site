<p>This document contains guidance notes for issue escalation and communications between workshop coordinators, the project lead, and the Steering Committee. It is meant to evolve over time.</p>
<h2 id="issues-requiring-steering-committee-clearance">Issues Requiring Steering Committee Clearance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Offers of sponsorship for individual workshops</li>
<li>Fee waivers for individual workshops</li>
<li>Instructor training classes</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Code of Conduct issues should always be brought to the project lead's attention, even if they have already been handled by the workshop instructors. The project lead should summarize any such events at Steering Committee meetings and provide details if requested.</p>
<h2 id="who-to-contact">Who to Contact</h2>
<p>If an item that requires Steering Committee clearance comes up - or if a workshop coordinator is simply unsure or has a question - the first point of contact is the project lead. If for any reason the workshop coordinator feels the project lead's response is unsatisfactory, he or she should approach a member of the Steering Committee directly.</p>
<p>(Having said that, all Steering Committee members have indicated that they are happy to be contacted directly by workshop coordinators, so don't be shy!)</p>
<h2 id="urgent-issues">Urgent Issues</h2>
<p>If the project lead (or any other Steering Committee member) has an issue that requires Steering Committee clearance prior to the next scheduled Steering Committee meeting, decisions can be made via email according to the following process:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The project lead (or Steering Committee member) emails the Steering Committee outlining the issue</p></li>
<li>Within one week, Steering Committee members respond with either:</li>
<li>their approval;</li>
<li>suggested amendments to the proposal/issue; or</li>
<li><p>a request to delay any decision until the next Steering Committee meeting</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An issue can be acted upon as soon as an approval response has been posted by more than three quarters of Steering Committee members, provided there are no requests for amendments or delay. Otherwise, at the end of the week the responses are tallied:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If all responses approve and more than half the Steering Committee have responded, the issue can be acted upon</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise the project lead (or Steering Committee member) must amend the issue/proposal and start the process again, or add the issue to the agenda for the next meeting</p></li>
</ul>

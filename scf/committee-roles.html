<h3 id="pathways-for-communication">Pathways for Communication</h3>
<p>General guidelines for handling issues through the Software Carpentry Foundation Steering Committee can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/issue-escalation.md">issue escalation guidelines</a>. In addition to that, general resources and pathways for communication vary based on the participants.</p>
<p>The key pathways for communication among the SCF Steering Committee include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular meetings by phone, scheduled by the Committee Chair</li>
<li>A mailing list for discussions and voting</li>
<li>Public and private GitHub repositories for document sharing</li>
</ul>
<p>The key pathways for communication between the SCF Committee members and the Advisory Council include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Occasional meetings combining both the Steering Committee and Advisory Council virtually or in person</li>
<li>A shared mailing list for inter-body communication</li>
<li>Public and private GitHub repositories for document sharing</li>
<li>Indirect communication through the Executive Director</li>
</ul>
<p>The key pathways for communication to sponsors and stakeholders include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indirect communication through the Executive Director and Coordinator staff members</li>
<li>Individual, existing relationships with those stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<p>The key pathways for communication with learners, instructors, and contributors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Coordinator staff member</li>
<li>Public Software Carpentry repositories on GitHub</li>
<li>Public Software Carpentry mailing lists (i.e. Discuss)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="methods-of-participation">Methods of Participation</h3>
<p>Participation must include 3 hours per week of Software Carpentry Foundation volunteer time. This minimum total volunteer time includes time spent in Steering Committee meetings.</p>
<p>Participation may involve any of a number of activities that serve the Software Carpentry Foundation.</p>
<ul>
<li>serving on subcommittees which serve the activities of the Steering Committee.</li>
<li>supporting initiatives prioritized by the Steering Committee and the Executive Director</li>
<li>organizing and overseeing evaluation and assessment</li>
<li>organizing and overseeing mentorship activities</li>
<li>fund-raising, writing grant proposals, forming collaborations, encouraging community members to write grant proposals, et.</li>
<li>writing blog posts, emails, and other updates to communicate Committee activities with the community</li>
<li>and much more...</li>
</ul>
<p>While continuing to be an instructor for workshops is welcomed, that work is independent of the participation requirements and does not count toward the requirement of 3 volunteer hours per week.</p>
<h3 id="elements-of-dedication">Elements of Dedication</h3>
<p>Dedication to the Software Carpentry Foundation relies heavily on familiarity with the policies and guidelines agreed upon by the community and by the Committee. Most importantly, Committee members must be familiar with and supportive of both the <a href="{{page.root}}/scf/index.html">Software Carpentry Foundation mission</a> and the <a href="{{page.root}}/conduct.html">Software Carpentry Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>
      Software Carpentry is a volunteer organization whose goal is
      to make scientists and engineers more productive,
      and their work more reliable,
      by teaching them basic computing skills.
      Founded in 1998,
      it runs short, intensive workshops that cover
      program design, version control, testing, and task automation.
    </p>

  <dt id="team"><em><strong>Who created all this?</strong></em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      <a href="{{page.root}}/team.html">Many people</a>
      have helped Software Carpentry grow
      by creating lessons,
      teaching boot camps,
      and building its web site.

  <dt id="who-funds-swc"><em><strong>Who pays for it?</strong></em></dt>

    <p>
      Our current work is sponsored primarily by
      the <a href="http://www.sloan.org">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a>
      and the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/">Mozilla Foundation</a>.
      More than <a href="{{page.root}}/sponsors.html">twenty other organizations</a>
      have supported us since we ran our first class
      at <a href="http://lanl.gov">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> in 1998.

  <dt id="what-is-boot-camp"><em><strong>What is a boot camp?</strong></em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      A boot camp is an intensive example-driven workshop,
      typically two days long,
      that covers the core skills needed to be productive in a small research team,
      including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	the basics of structured programming in Python or R;
      </li>
      <li>
	version control using Subversion, Git or Mercurial;
      </li>
      <li>
	unit testing using an xUnit-style framework;
	and
      </li>
      <li>
	automating tasks using the Unix shell.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Short tutorials alternate with hands-on practical exercises,
      and participants are encouraged both to help one another,
      and to apply what they are learning to their own research problems
      during, between, and after sessions.
      Participants usually use their own computers (typically laptops)
      so that they leave with a working environment set up,
      though we also provide a standard set of packages running in a virtual machine.

  <dt id="why-boot-camp"><em><strong>Why boot camps?</strong></em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Between 1998 and 2012,
      we taught this material in intensive week-long courses,
      as a regular university course,
      and online,
      with varying degrees of frustration.
      It turns out that researchers are busy people:
      improving their computing skills will make them more productive in the long run,
      but in the short run,
      they have to get a grant proposal in by Thursday,
      mark mid-terms by Monday,
      and meet a paper deadline next week.
      While two days may not sound like much,
      it's all many researchers can fit in.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="boot-camp-audience"><em><strong>Who are boot camps for?</strong></em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Our learners are typically graduate students
      in science, engineering, medicine, and related research-intensive disciplines
      who have written a few lines of code
      (either on their own or for an "Intro to Computing" class as undergrads)
      but aren't familiar with computing's equivalent of good laboratory practices.
      <a href="{{page.root}}/audience.html">These short bios</a>
      are representative of their needs
      and how we can help.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="testimonials"><em><strong>Do boot camps really work?</strong></em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Yes: two independent studies in 2012 found that people really were learning useful things,
      and <a href="{{page.root}}/testimonials.html">these testimonials</a> from past participants
      show just how much difference a little training can make.

  <dt id="why-else-attend"><em><strong>Why else should I attend a boot camp?</strong></em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Boot camps are a great opportunity to network with like-minded researchers.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="boot-camp-format"><em><strong>What does a typical boot camp look like?</strong></em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Boot camps usually run for two consecutive days,
      starting at 8:30 and running to 4:30 or 5:00 each day
      with breaks for coffee and lunch.
      A typical boot has 40 learners,
      2 instructors,
      and 2-3 helpers wandering the room answering questions during practical sessions.
      (These helpers are often alumni of previous boot camps
      who are hoping to become instructors themselves.)
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="boot-camp-costs"><em><strong>Are boot camps free?</strong></em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The costs associated with particular boot camps are covered by their hosts:
      our instructors are volunteers,
      so these costs usually amount to air fare and accommodation
      (if instructors are coming from out of town)
      plus a contribution of approximately $1500 toward central overheads,
      which often comes from charging learners a small fee (typically $40).
      As a bonus,
      we have found that this small charge reduces the number of people
      who register but do not attend
      from 20-25% to approximately 5%.

      If you'd like us to teach a boot camp for you,
      the first step is to <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">get in touch</a>.
      We'll find instructors in your geographic and/or academic area,
      and do advertising, registration, and software setup,
      while you'll take care of travel costs and administrative overheads,
      booking space,
      local publicity,
      finding helpers,
      and catering (if desired).

    <p>
      There is one caveat, however.
      The name "Software Carpentry" and our logo are both trademarked,
      and may not be used without our permission:
      we're all in favor of teaching people iPhone game programming,
      multigrid methods using C++ and MPI,
      and scientific grant writing,
      but we've worked hard to establish an identity for Software Carpentry,
      and wish to protect it.
      We will usually give permission to any training that covers the four basic topic areas
      of structured programming, task automation, version control, and testing,
      but encourage people who want to teach this material
      to take part in the instructor training discussed below before doing so.

  <dt id="how-become-instructor"><em><strong>How can I become an instructor myself?</strong></em></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      We offer a free online training course for people who would like to teach Software Carpentry,
      and to learn more about teaching in general along the way.
      The course takes 2-4 hours a week for 12-14 weeks (depending on interruptions);
      most work is done on trainees' own time,
      and is posted to the <a href="http://teaching.software-carpentry.org">course blog</a>.
      While the training is open to anyone,
      space is limited,
      and we do give preference to people who have taken part in a boot camp themselves,
      or have relevant prior experience.
      For more information,
      please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">send us email</a>.

      If you don't want to teach,
      there are many other ways you can help,
      such as writing new lessons,
      answering learners' questions online,
      and maintaining this web site.
      Please see <a href="{{page.root}}/contributing.html">this page</a> for details.

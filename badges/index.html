<p>
  The web provides many new ways to gain skills and experience,
  including online courses, learning networks, mentorship, and peer learning.
  Digital badges provide an open, portable, verifiable way
  for learners to get recognition for what they know.
  Using Mozilla's <a href="http://openbadges.org">Open Badge Infrastructure</a>,
  Software Carpentry is issuing kinds of badges for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="creator.html">creators</a> who are producing teaching materials,
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="instructor.html">instructors</a> who are qualified to teach our bootcamps,
    and
  </li>
  <li>
    the <a href="organizer.html">organizers</a> who make those bootcamps possible.
  </li>
</ul>

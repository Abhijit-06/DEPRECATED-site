  <h4>Before the Workshop</h4>
  <p>
 Preamble: can make life easier for everyone if event planners
  consider things in advance rather than forcing people to ask for
  things. Things to think about:
 </p>
  <ul>
<li>
    Does the sign-up form ask if learners need arrangements made
    ahead of time (e.g. sign-language interpreters, large-print
    printouts, special dietary needs)?
</li>
    
    <li>
      Is the room easily accessible to those who cannot use stairs?
  Are the elevators available at all times? Are there accesssible
  washrooms nearby?
   </li>
  <li>
   Would there be any problem with having a service animal in the
      room? [Shouldn't be, unless it's a wet lab.]
   </li>
  <li>
   Is the room lighting sufficiently bright to allow lip-reading? Is
  the projector screen large enough to be easily read?
   </li>
<li>
   If the room is large or noisy, is a microphone available for the
  instructors?
</li>
<li>
WHAT ELSE?
</li>

 </ul>
<p>
    If learners indicate that advance arrangements are needed, the
 host needs to follow-up on this to make sure things are ready, and
 let the instructors know if action is required on their part.
 Your institution may have a "Disability Services Office" that can
 help with some of these issues. LINKS HERE to useful websites?

  <h4>During the workshop</h4>
  <p>
  Preamble re: asking folks what they need, rather than
  assuming. Trying to anticipate needs is good, but maintaining
  independence & dignity also important.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Designate one helper as (need a title here) -- this person to be
  in charge of physical arrangements. 
   </li>
    <li>
      Having everyone introduce themselves when they speak is helpful
  for people with low vision, as well as everyone else with a full memory.
   </li>

    All of our slides, notes, and example programs are in
    <a href="{{page.root}}/lesson.html">our Git repositories</a>
    under <a href="{{page.root}}/license.html">open access licenses</a>:
    you are free to use them however you want
    so long as you <a href="{{page.root}}/license.html">cite us as the source</a>.
    Everything is designed so that individuals can work through what they need on their own,
    but universities, research labs, companies, and self-study groups have also used it
    in week-long crash courses and as part of longer classroom courses.

    took a detour to work for the UN in New York after completing his
    MS in neuroscience at McGill University in Canada. He was
    impressed by the culture of learning in the UN office and became
    fascinated by how adults learn new skills. Back then and there he also had a hypothesis that good data skills would make nonprofit organizations more efficient. He first read about Software Carpentry after reading a <a href = "http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101013/full/467775a.html">Nature article</a> recommended by a colleague while in grad school. 2 years later he went for the SWC instructor training and immediately regretted not doing it sooner. Currently he is testing his earlier hypothesis by running a startup.

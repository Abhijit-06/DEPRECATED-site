    <a href="http://nipy.org/" class="project">NIPY</a> (Neuroimaging in
  Python) is making it easier to do better brain imaging research, by designing
  and implementing free and open-source algorithms and pipelines for the
  analysis of data from neuroimaging experiments, and teaching neuroscientists
  how to use them. We believe that neuroscience ideas and analysis ideas
  develop together. Good ideas come from understanding; understanding comes
  from clarity, and clarity must come from well-designed teaching materials and
  well-designed software.

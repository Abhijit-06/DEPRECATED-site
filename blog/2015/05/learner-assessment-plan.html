<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  The assessment subcommittee seeks to assess the effectiveness of the
activities of the Software Carpentry Foundation (SCF).  The E-board
met <a href='https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/subcommittees/assessment/minutes-2015-05-04.md'>a
few weeks ago</a> and drafted an action plan on how to move forward
with regards to creating a series of assessments for our learners.
This action plan will be the basis on how further assessment tools
will be developed.

We've created
a <a href='https://github.com/swcarpentry/assessment'>repository</a>
and opened a
few <a href='https://github.com/swcarpentry/assessment/issues'>issues<a>
to get the ball rolling for discussion.  The goal is to brainstorm a
list of questions we want to ask our learners with respect to:

<ul>
  <li>Attitude/opinions/mindsets</li>
  <li>Facts/declarative knowledge</li>
  <li>Actual, testable skills</li>
<ul>

This will be an iterative process where the rest of the assessment
committee (and anyone else who is interested) will add any number of
questions that would be useful to assess our learners.  We will then
refine the questions over a series of workshops and test for validity
and reliability.

Please head over to
the <a href='https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/subcommittees/assessment/minutes-2015-05-04.md'>meeting
notes</a>, where we have a section on "Advice for writing questions"

In addition to community input on potential questions we are also
seeking feedback on how best to organize the issue board for
discussion as more assessments are being developed.  We are
considering using issue tags and/or naming conventions, since it seems
like the first logical step, but are open to critiques.

The goal is to use the summer workshops to refine the first assessment
questionnaire so we can start collecting data by the Fall.

<p>
  The mentorship team met last week for a discussion with instructors who recently taught workshops. Instructors from workshops at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and University of Texas at Arlington (the latter of which was taught by both authors of this post). :

<b>Things that worked well:</b>
<ul>
	<li>
	<i>Teaching R and Python together:</i> University of Melbourne ambitiously covered Unix, Git, SQL, Python and R over a three day workshop. Although they reported some learning fatigue near the end, the lesson pacing was appropriate and they received largely positive feedback. R and RStudio were taught first, followed by Python and a short introduction to Jupyter Notebook, which allowed instructors to highlight parallels between the scripting language and their respective interfaces.
	</li>
	<li>
	<i>Making Git interactive:</i> Git can be a difficult topic for beginners to comprehend, but there are a few methods our instructors reported working well. Building a concept map during the lesson can help students build a mental framework for how the parts of Git work together (<a href="https://twitter.com/chendaniely/status/583689081151979520">example picture</a> from Weill Cornell Medical College). Second, pairing students up to work on the collaboration with GitHub lesson has been received well in multiple workshops.
	</li>
	<li>
	<i>Word clouds to summarize student feedback:</i> Instructors from University of Melbourne compiled student feedback each day and presented wordclouds using previous methods taught (R, Python, shell, repo <a href="https://github.com/lonsbio/swc-wordclouds">here</a>). This seems like a great way to showcase how to perform the same task in different ways.

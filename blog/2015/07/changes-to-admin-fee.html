<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  After discussion with our Advisory Council and Data Carpentry, we
  have agreed to make some changes to the administration fee we charge
  for workshops that we help organize in order to reflect the real
  cost of our staff's time and our overheads, and to reflect the value
  of the training:
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      If a host site arranges instructors and handles registration,
      they do not owe us an administration fee.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If we are involved in getting instructors or managing
      registration, the host owes us $2500 per workshop if the host is
      not a partner or affiliate, and $1250 per workshop if they are.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If a partner or affiliate recruits instructors and handles
      registration for another host, without using either SCF staff
      time or any staff time they might owe SCF, then they may charge
      what they like for the service (including nothing). If they do
      charge a fee, we strongly encourage them to make it similar to
      ours.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We will continue to be generous with waivers for organizations
      that would otherwise not be able to afford them.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  These rules keep us in step with Data Carpentry, which recently
  decided to make similar changes in their administrative
  fees&mdash;the only significant differences is that Data Carpentry
  doesn't yet have a partnership or affiliation scheme, so there are
  no discounts for DC workshops.  The new administrative fees will
  apply to workshops whose dates and/or instructors are finalized
  after October 1, 2015.  (Note that the transition is based on when
  the arrangements are finalized, not when the workshop takes place.)

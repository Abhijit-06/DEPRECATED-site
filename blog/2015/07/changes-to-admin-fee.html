<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  After discussion with our Advisory Council and
  <a href="http://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a>, we have
  agreed to make some changes to the administration fee we charge for
  workshops that we help organize:
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<ol>
  <li>
    If a host site arranges instructors and handles registration, they
    do not owe us an administration fee.
  </li>
  <li>
    If we are involved in getting instructors or managing
    registration, the host owes us $2500 per workshop if they are not
    a partner or affiliate, and $1250 per workshop if they are.  This
    price increase matches Data Carpentry's, which recently decided to
    the same change in their administrative fees.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a partner or affiliate recruits instructors and handles
    registration for another host, without using either SCF staff time
    or any staff time they might owe SCF, then they may charge what
    they like for the service (including nothing).  If they do charge
    a fee, we strongly encourage them to make it similar to ours.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will continue to be generous with waivers for organizations
    that would otherwise not be able to afford them.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The new administrative fees will apply to all workshops whose dates
  are finalized after September 1, 2015.  (Note that the transition is
  based on when the dates for the workshop are finalized, not when the
  workshop itself takes place.)  If you have any questions, please
  <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">get in touch</a>.

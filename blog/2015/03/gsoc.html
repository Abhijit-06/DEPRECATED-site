<p>
  A few weeks ago we announced that we will help
  <a href="http://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>
  to apply to Google Summer of Code (GSoC) as a mentoring organization.
  Yesterday the list of mentoring organization was announced
  and NumFOCUS was selected.

  I want to thanks very much (in alphabetical order)
  to Andy Terrel, Ethan White, Matt Sottile and W. Trevor King
  that volunteer to be mentors and make this possible.
</p>
<p>
  We have a list of ideas
  <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/gsoc2015/blob/master/ideas-list.md">here</a>
  but students can apply with their own idea
  and in this case we suggest to follow
  <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/gsoc2015/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#students">this instructions</a>
  so we could help polish the ideas.
  <strong>Application on
    <a href="http://numfocus.org/projects/index.html">any project supported by NumFOCUS</a>
    are welcome.</strong>

<p>
  I spent the better part of the last three weeks working on an NSF-IOS Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDIG) proposal.
  Pretty much daily,
  I consulted this <a href="http://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2012/08/10/a-list-of-publicly-available-grant-proposals-in-the-biological-sciences/">list of publically available grants proposals in the biological sciences</a>
  to look at other people's proposals.
  This is an awesome resource if you want to see how people write their project description.
  However, there are no links to example Data Management Plans, Facilities, Summaries, etc.
  Where does one go for examples of or advice on these supplementary documents?
</p>
<p>
  The last page of NSF's <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bio/pubs/BIODMP_Guidance.pdf">updated information about the Data Management Plan</a>
  urges readers to check out Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry for resources and training.
</p>
<p>
  This is a huge shout-out
  (see <a href="https://twitter.com/elekonich/status/651429708404531200">these</a>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/raynamharris/status/651438007581446144">tweets</a>),
  so, how example can SWC and Data Carpentry members help?
  Here are my initial thoughts.

  Here's the advice on and examples of <b>Data Management Plans</b>
  that I found as well as my thoughts on how the Software and Data Carpentry community can contribute.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://dmptool.org/">DMPTool</a> seems to be the most commonly recommended tool
      as it has templates that will walk you step-by-step through creating a funding agency-specific plan.
      I followed their guidelines suggestions as I revamped my PIs data management plan to fit my proposal.

      <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2012/12/sample-data-management-plans.html">This blog post from 2012</a>
      includes links to five NSF data management plans (for
      <a href="https://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DMP_MaunaLoa_Formatted.pdf">CO2 data</a>,
      <a href="https://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DMP_Hydrologic_Formatted.pdf">ground water data</a>,
      <a href="https://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DMP_HDFMap_Formatted.pdf">HDF files</a>,
      <a href="https://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DMP_NutNet_Formatted.pdf">bug collection</a>,
      and <a href="https://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DMP_Copepod_Formatted.pdf">copepod growth</a>).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The genomic community is growing rapidly,
  and <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002195">so are our data sets</a>.
  These are useful,
  but I really wanted some examples for Next Generation Sequencing Data.
  Where can I find examples or templates for managing my (future) massive amounts of Illumina Data?
  If someone knows, please share.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>1. Continue teaching Git and Github.</b>
      I learned how to use Git during my first workshop and I never looked back.
      I mentioned GitHub for sharing and disseminating data in my proposal.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>2. Create a page of data management plans.</b>
      It seems like it shouldn't be that hard to have a webpage with lots of examples of data management plans
      covering a wide range of data types in the natural sciences and beyond.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>3. Host an <a href="{{site.github_io_url}}/instructor-retreat-2015/">Instructor Retreat</a> session on Data Management.</b>
      If someone who is passionate and knowledgeable about data management,
      it might be useful to broadcast and archive a brief tutorial about data management plan for that current and future researchers.

  Please reply if you have some resources to share or are interested in continuing the discussion.
  Happy data collecting!

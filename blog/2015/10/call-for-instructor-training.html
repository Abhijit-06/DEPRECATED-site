<h3 id="application-sample">Application Sample</h3>
<p>Dear SCF Mentoring Subcommittee,</p>
<p>we are writing to express our interested to attend the two-day training course in December 2015 as one group composed by:</p>
<ul>
<li>NAME_OF_1ST_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub),</li>
<li>NAME_OF_2ND_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub),</li>
<li>NAME_OF_3RD_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub),</li>
<li>NAME_OF_4TH_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub),</li>
<li>NAME_OF_5TH_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub) and</li>
<li>NAME_OF_6TH_STUDENT (GITHUB_ID on GitHub).</li>
</ul>
<p>NAME_OF_1ST_STUDENT attended a SCF workshop in 2014, NAME_OF_2ND_STUDENT attended a SCF workshop in 2015. and NAME_OF_3RD_STUDENT attended a DC workshop in 2015. NAME_OF_1ST_STUDENT was a helper at the last SCF/DC workshop organized at our university that was lead by INSTRUCTOR_NAME.</p>
<p>If we are selected for the instructor training we will use the conference room of our department that you can check below. We already made reservations for that room in advance.</p>
<p>We are planing to organize two workshops at the beginning of 2016. One will be Python based and will have NAME_OF_1ST_STUDENT, NAME_OF_2ND_STUDENT, NAME_OF_4TH_STUDENT and INSTRUCTOR_NAME as instructors. The other one will be R based and will have NAME_OF_3RD_STUDENT, NAME_OF_5TH_STUDENT, NAME_OF_6TH_STUDENT and INSTRUCTOR_NAME as instructors. We will use the same room used for the last workshop and we already talked with INSTRUCTOR_NAME about those workshops.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration.</p>

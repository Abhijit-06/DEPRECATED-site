<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
Sorry for the month delay to publish this blog post.
The mentoring subcommittee continue to host the debriefing session as usual
but due others activities the blog post about the debriefings get delay.
</p>
<p>
On September 15th the mentoring subcommittee held the 18th round of debriefing for instructors.
At this round we have a great discussion about teach (or not) branches during the Git lesson
and about Python packages used in examples.
</p>

<h2>Can we hit zero installation issues?</h2>
<p>
Instructors reported that they still encountering some installation issues
during the workshops that they or the helpers solve in a couple of minutes.
The more common are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>nano isn't installed,</li>
  <li>old version of OS X, Windows or a GNU/Linux distribution and</li>
  <li>wrong version of Python (that should reduce know that Continuum Analytics update their download page).</li>
</ul>
<p>
On this lines,
there is also the problem of <code>man</code> not be installed by Git Bash on Windows.
</p>
<p>
And in one of the workshops,
instructors had problem due cyrilic characters.
</p>
<h2>Cheat Sheets</h2>
<p>
Learners from one of the workshops suggested at the feedbacks
that instructors provide a cheat sheet at the begin of the workshop
so the learners could consult what they learn easily.
</p>
<p>
The "Reference" part of our lessons is closer to a cheat sheet
and can be provide to students.
You can print the "Reference" direct from your web browser
since it has one special CSS for printers.
</p>
<h2>Jupyter Notebook and scroll</h2>
<p>
Instructors reported that they are having problems to show enough code for learners
when using Jupyter Notebook.
Unfortunately we didn't find one good solution to this.
</p>
<h2>Branches</h2>
<p>
We discussed if we should or shouldn't teach branches during the Git lesson.
Branch is a powerful tool that enables you to experiment different things
and avoid the problem of different copies of the files.
Unfortunately is more one thing to learners understand during the workshop
and it can create big problems for beginners.
</p>
<h2>Packages for examples</h2>
<p>
We also discussed that some packages are more suitable for some audiences.
For example, Pandas is more suitable for learners that need to do data analysis
and NumPy is more suitable for learners that need to process/create data.

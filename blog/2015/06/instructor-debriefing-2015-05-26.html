This round of debriefing covered seven workshops.  We had a gooddiscussion of core curriculum, installation topics, timing, and so on.  Several of the workshops were a bit departure from the normal run of two-day workshops and I will highlight some points below.

<h2> Western University (http://pbarmby.github.io/2015-05-11-westernu)</h2>
This was a three-day workshop that covered an unusual breadth of topics.  They covered shell, git, Python, R, SQL and MATLAB, with two rooms and concurrent sessions for Python and MATLAB.  R was very popular and was covered for all of the 30 participant.  They used the standard lessons, for the most part and the workshop went very well, with only a few R installation issues.


<h2>Stellenbosch University (http://lgatto.github.io/2015-05-14-Stellenbosch/)</h2>.
This was and R-focused workshop with Partially remote instruction.
Remote workshops have to be handles idfferently. The audio and video need to be fast.  The experience with this workshop was that the participants didn't interact very much. Instructors and helpers need to mindful that learners need to ask questions. The local instructors played an important role in improving the interactively of the lessons. It would be helpful to have more interaction between remote and local instructors. They used Google Hangouts, with the local instructor's laptop connected to one TV and audio system. The resolution of the TV was OK and the sound was also OK but in the feedback some people mention that couldn't hear me. The etherpad was not used very much. They used a second monitor with one for the etherpad and one shared for other purposes.

Overall, the remote remote teaching outcome was not entirely satisfactory and, for an optimal experience for the participants, the main instructor should not be remote.

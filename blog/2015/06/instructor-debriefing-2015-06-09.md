title: "2015 Post-Workshop Instructor Debriefing, Round 11"
date: 2015-06-12

category: ["Teaching"]

We held our 11th round of instructor debriefing last week. We discussed the Software 
Carpentry workshops held at the University of Oslo, University of Connecticut, University 
of Campinas, University of the Basque Country, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Berkeley Institute 
for Data Science, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, and Oklahoma State University, as 
well as a Data Carpentry workshop at the National Data Integrity Conference at Colorado 
State University. This debriefing we also had 3 instructors join us (who have yet to 
teach a workshop but will be teaching one in the near future) to gain an insight about 
what works (and what doesn't) at our workshops out in the wild.

<p>
  At the begin of Rémi Emonet, June Kwasi Kwakwa and Chelsea Chisholm
  ran a workshop at CERN.
  <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/team.html#emonet.remi">Rémi</a>
  has just posted a review of
  <a href="http://home.heeere.com/teach-swc-cern-201506.html">that workshop</a>.
  It went well,
  and there are a lot of good ideas in his write-up &mdash;
  from whiteboard for diagrams to IPython Notebook sucessor (<a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>)
  passing by advanced topics.

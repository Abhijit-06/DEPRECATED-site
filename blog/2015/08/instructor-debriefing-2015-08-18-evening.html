<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>On August 18th the mentoring subcommittee hosted the 16th round of instructor debriefing. This edition we decided to have two blog post to cover all the good discussions so please also check <a href="">the blog post about the morning session</a>.

<h2>Congratulations</h2>
<p>I like to congrats instructors that taught the first time for us since doing it isn't as much easy as we would like to be and we need to work on that. If you have suggestions of what we can do to help instructors when they are preparing for the first workshop contact us.</p>
<p>And we have our first workshop at Indonesia which means less one country for we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_%28game%29">win the game</a>.</p>
<h2>Dataset collection for workshops</h2>
<p>One thing that always got learners more engaged is using dataset from their fields of study at the lessons. Last year I had the pleasure to taught with <a href="{{site.site_url}}/pages/team.html#viana.a">Alex Viana</a> at a <a href="https://acviana.github.io/2014-08-28-ufrgs">workshop</a> that the host provided us with <a href="https://github.com/acviana/2014-08-28-ufrgs/blob/gh-pages/data/estmet/data.txt">some climate data</a> to use and this contribute a lot for the success of the workshop. Unfortunately do it is always a challenge mostly because in the general</p>
<ul>
  <li>instructors aren't from the same background of learners,</li>
  <li>workshops have learners from two or three different backgrounds, and</li>
  <li>popular datasets are complex and can distract learners unfamiliar with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you remember one workshop that you or someone used a dataset different from the one in our lessons (inflammation and gapminder) please mention it at the comments of this post.</p>
<p>And if you have suggestions of how we can collect and organize good datasets for our workshops please get in touch with us (comments at this post, post reply, GitHub issue, email, ... will work for us).</p>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>We already have a <a href="{{site.site_url}}/workshops/checklists/accessibility.html">accessibility checklist</a> for workshops but we want to offer more guidelines for our instructors, for example good color scheme for the terminal.</p>
<h2>Breaking the ice</h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenges for every instructor at each workshop s/he teach is breaking the ice so that students are confortable to ask questions and actively participate at the workshop. One suggestion for help at this talk is that the host organize a dinner for instructors and learners at the night before the workshop which also gives the opportunity for instructors discovery the expectations of the learners for the workshop. When dinner is not possible, have coffee/tea and snacks available at the very begin of the workshop should also help.</p>

<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>The mentorship committee held their latest round of debriefing for instructors of recent workshops on Tuesday, August 18. This post highlights the themes discussed in the morning session (you can read about the evening debriefing session <a href="{{site.site_url}}/blog/2015/08/instructor-debriefing-2015-08-18-evening">here</a>). Our participants included multiple levels of experience, including new instructors and experienced instructors who were preparing to teach again soon. The most difficult aspects of their experiences are described below, as well as things that work well and may assist in ameliorating problems.

<h2>What was difficult</h2>
<p>We continued discussions from <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/08/instructor-debriefing-2015-08-07.html">previous debriefing sessions</a> about pacing lessons and how to trim down material for the time allowed for a module. One possible strategy is to ask students what material they are interested in covering (for example, if time for Unix is running short, ask if students would like to finish up the section on Shell Scripts, or have a brief overview of Finding Things). Making these decisions is even more complicated if students have questions about integration of tools (for example, using shell scripting and R together), which is certainly a concept students will encounter when developing their own research tools. We are also still seeking an effective method for helping students stay on track during the Python lessons, as commands entered move up and off the demo screen with graphical and text output in iPython notebooks.</p>
<p>In addition to these common impediments, we also spent some time discussing more uncommon but disruptive events. For example, severe weather may lead to power outages, which results in greatly diminished time for instruction. In other cases, instructors who are not local may have flight delays or otherwise be unable to attend a workshop, leaving the remaining instructors to cover modules unexpectedly. There are no easy answers for these circumstances, but certainly stress that instructors should at least consider ahead of time how to adjust their practices on-the-fly. As always, instructors are encouraged to contact the <a href="mailto:mentoring@lists.software-carpentry.org">
mentoring subcommittee</a> for reminders about where resources are located or to talk about preparing for upcoming workshops.</p>

<h2>What worked well</h2>
<p>A general solution to the afore mentioned problem of running out of time is having a list of links handy to share with students. This may be as simple as pointing them towards the rest of the canonical Software Carpentry lessons, including sections that you may have chosen to leave out of your teaching for the workshop. Instructors at this debriefing reported that more advanced learners appreciated links to the intermediate lessons for a some topics, which helped keep them engaged during the lesson. A recently planned workshop includes a third day for a hackathon, which allows students to start working on code for their own data and projects and may allow more discussion about integration of lessons described above.</p>
<p>As Software Carpentry continues to grow and teach more workshops, we are encountering increasing numbers of instructors teaching remotely. We had a great discussion at this debriefing session about what works best for remote instruction, the main points of which are conveyed in a <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/06/remote-workshop-cape-town.html"> previous blog post</a>. I personally hope to continue bolstering our expertise in remote instruction, which may help alleviate the problems described above with instructor travel difficulties (if technology allows).

<p>The mentorship committee held their latest round of debriefing for instructors of recent workshops on Tuesday, August 18. This post highlights the themes discussed in the morning session, which was attended by

<h2>Interesting ideas to consider</h2>
<p>The experienced instructors in our debriefing session compared recent workshops and correpsonding materials with their previous teaching experiences. Discussions with these folks are especially important given their comparatively large sample size of how students respond to certain approaches. In particular, we talked about the benefits of slowly introducing concepts in Python and R compared to jumping right into advanced topics and explaining mechanisms as the lessons progressed. For example, the <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder">R gapminder lesson</a> can start with impressive, powerful packages like dplyr and tidyR to motivate students. However, this can be confusing to students new to programming, and will require backtracking later in the lesson to explain more basic concepts. This problem is can sometimes be alleviated by appropriately contextualizing the point of the lesson (i.e., automation of work, rather than learning how every algorithm works). Conversations about these issues are ongoing on GitHub and in various listservs (see the <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation/issues/127">novice Python lesson</a> for an example).</p>

<h2>What was difficult</h2>
<p>Figuring out how to trim down copious lesson materials to fit the alloted time for a class continues to be problematic, especially for the Python and R materials (but see below). We recommend that experienced instructors partnered with new instructors for upcoming workshops share their thoughts about how to cut out sections of lessons. New instructors can also contact the <a href="mailto:mentoring@lists.software-carpentry.org">
mentoring subcommittee</a> for assistance in selecting material.</p>

<h2>What worked well</h2>
<p>While having too much material for a topic included in the lessons can be a burden on instructors, the advantage is being able to more carefully cater the lesson to the audience. Instructors from SciPy, for example, included introductions to the packages NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and matplotlib, because students were likely to encounter these later in the conference. More information about these lessons were written up in a <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/07/scipy-2015.html">previous blog post</a>.</p>

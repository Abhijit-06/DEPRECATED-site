<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  I spent part of the weekend chatting with a friend in Cambridge
  who used to be science editor at <em>The Independent</em>
  and now edits <a href="http://scientific-computing.com/"><em>Scientific Computing World</em></a>.
  During those conversations,
  I realized that there are three graphs I'd really like to see:
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Ask the managers of high-performance computing centers what fraction of their budget they spent on hardware, software, and training,
      and what fractions they would <em>like</em> to spend.
      My prediction is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="hst.png" alt="Hardware, Software, and Training" class="responsive" />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Measure how much computing power all of the scientists at a university (not just those with HPC accounts) use during a year.
      My prediction is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="flops.png" alt="Computing Power per Year" class="responsive" />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Classify all the support requests received by HPC center staff according to technical complexity,
      and see how that changes after something like a two-day Software Carpentry workshop.
      My prediction is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="support.png" alt="Support Requests" class="responsive" />
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The first tells us how much political interference skews computing priorities.
  (Off the record, everyone will admit that bureaucrats' desire for photo ops with big iron takes precedence over mere research.)
  The second will show the mis-match between where computing dollars and euros are spent,
  and what most scientists actually do,
  while the third will show that training doesn't just help scientists do more research:
  it also improves the return on investment in highly-skilled support staff,
  who would much rather be helping people parallelize their code
  than resurrect files from former grad students' accounts.

I started out as molecular biologist postdoc working in functional genomics.  
My boss at the time said "You! Learn to program". So I put down my pipettor and 
learned how to code.  An autodidact, I committing just about every imaginable sin 
against best practices.  I eventually started to interact with others of my kind, 
repented, developed an interest in outreach and training and became an evangelist 
bent on helping others see light and avoid the mistakes I made as a neophyte 
bioinformatician.  The past ten years I contributed to various scientific computing 
training efforts with the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory "Programming for Biology" course, 
the Generic Model Organism Database Project, the iPlant Collaborative and, most recently, 
Software Carpentry.

<p>
I started out as molecular biologist postdoc working in functional genomics.  To facilitate this work,
I eventually put down my pipettor and learned how to work with computers.  With the 
perspective of a person who transitioned from the wet lab to informatics, I have often served as a 
liaison between researchers and software developers and really enjoy helping to empowering scientists
by teaching them computing skills to accelerate their research.  The past ten years I have contributed 
to various training efforts in scientific computing and have helped organize and presented many workshops
and trainig events.  When I learned about Software Carpentry, its mission resonated with me.  I completed the instructor
training in May last year, taught at six workshops since then and continue to do about one workshop 
every six weeks.  I would like to contribute more to the Software Carpentry foundation and its ongoing success
by becoming a member of the steering committee.

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
I have an PhD in genetics and transitioned to bioinformatics in 2001.  I have been very fortunate to work on several 
international collaborations, that support computing resources for life sciences, such as <a href="wormbase.org">WormBase</a>, the <a href="modencode.org">model organism
ENCODE project</a>, the <a href="iplantc.org">iPlant Collaborative</a>, the <a href="reactome.org">
Reactome Knowledgebase</a> and the 
<a href="http://oicr.on.ca/news/portal-newsletter/fighting-cancer-cloud-new-project-open-genomic-analysis-cancer-genomes-scientists-worldwide">
PanCancer Collaboratory</a>.  I currently work as a consultant for the 
Ontario Institute for Cancer Research.  I have gained a lot of experience in scientific computing, 
which is useful in the training other scientists how to use basic computing skills and best practices to 
maximize their efficiency and further their research.   
I have been involved in quite a few outreach and training activites the past ten years, such as the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory 
<a href="http://meetings.cshl.edu/courses/2015/c-info15.shtml"> Programming for Biology</a> course,
the <a href="http://gmod.org/wiki/GMOD_Schools">Generic Model Organism Database</a> project, the 
<a href="http://evomics.org/workshops/workshop-on-genomics/">Workshop on Comparative Genomics</a>
and <a href="http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/about-iplant/education-outreach-training">iPlant training workshops</a>.

<h3>Commitment</h3>
<p>
Although I have intructed at more training workshops than I can recall over the past decade, I always feel the need to improve as 
an instructor and try to learn how to do this at every opportunity.  From conversations with workshop hosts and participants, 
it is quite clear that Software Carpentry is succeeding in it mission and, equally important, that the Software Carpentry 
brand is associated with quality training materials and instruction.  From my own experiences in the field and 
war stories shared with me by others, there is always room for improvement.  As a member of the steering 
committee, I would be interested in contributing to assessment of our workshops, training materials and the continuing 
development of our instructors. In particular, I would be willing to take on responsibilites for mentoring 
newly qualified instructors and conducting regular post-workshop debriefing meetings to capture first-person feedback 
from instructors about how the workshops went, what worked and did not work,

<p>
  One year and a half back I read the
  <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/06/14/5992/">announce of Mozilla Science Lab by Mark Surman</a>
  and that way I discovery Software Carpentry.
  Months later, I was participating in the
  <a href="http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/08/18/round-6-1-concept-maps/">6th Instructors Training</a>
  that end at the end of 2013. Over the past year I have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>taught at all workshops held in Brazil (was 6),</li>
  <li>improved the lessons and helped new instructors doing it too,</li>
  <li>suggested changes to the new layout of our lessons and helped in the transition,</li>
  <li>publicized Software Carpentry.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Volunteering with Software Carpentry is one of the things that I'm really
  proud of doing and I'd be honored be a member of the SCF Steering Committee.

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
  I'm almost sure that I'm the younger member that is applying for the Steering
  Committee and because of it I didn't have amazing things to say about me. I'm
  finishing my Bachelor in Apply Mathematics at the University of Campinas after
  try and fail that some undergraduate and graduate colegues adopted better
  research practices like
  script your data analyse <strong>in what tool you prefer</strong> instead of
  write down on paper <strong>by hand</strong> all the
  data need for analyse the effect of changes in a linear programming problem
  solver.
</p>
<h3>Commitment</h3>
<p>
  As a member of the SCF Steering Committee I'd like to focus
  on increase our activities in Latin America, specially Brazil, by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Running at least as many workshops as we did last year in Brazil.</strong>
    Running workshops is one of the most important activities of Software
    Carpentry because is the way that we advertise ourself and draw new
    instructors.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Increase the number of instructors based on Brazil.</strong>
    To run more workshops in Brazil is vital that we have more instructors in
    Brazil (hopefully
    <a href="{{site_url}}/blog/2014/11/instructor-training-stats.html">we will have three more instructors in Brazil after the next online instructor training round</a>).
    To be sincere I don't know how to do that but I believe that the Steering
    Committee can help me with that.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Translate the lessons to Portuguese.</strong>
    To spread our activities in Brazil we will need to translate our lessons to
    Portuguese. To do that we also need more instructors that speak Portuguese.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Find ways to support our activities in Brazil.</strong>
    Unfortunately, as much as we wish, we can't do all the previous things
    without some type of financial support (e.g. air plane tickets and
    accommodations for instructors). So, if I was elected I will spend most of
    my time searching for grants and events that could support the cost of our
    workshops.
  </li>
</ul>

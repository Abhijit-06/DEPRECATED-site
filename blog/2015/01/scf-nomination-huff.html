<p>
  I have been involved in Software Carpentry for over six years, beginning as 
  an instructor, organizer, and curriculum developer. I have 
  been thrilled grow as a researcher alongside Software Carpentry, which has 
  grown beautifully over that time. In these years, I have organized 
  and taught over a dozen workshops and have, for the last four months, served 
  as an interim Steering Committee member. I have also made an effort to bring 
  Software Carpentry into the written format as a co-author of both 
  <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001745">the Best Practices paper</a> 
  and a new O'Reilly book, 
  <a href="physics.codes">"Effective Computation in Physics: Field Guide to Research in Python."</a>.
  Of course, none of this pays the bills.  For that, 
  I am a nuclear engineer...

<p>
  My scientific background includes a BA in Physics (University of Chicago, 
  2008) and a PhD in Nuclear Engineering (University of Wisconsin - Madison, 
  2013). I am currently a postdoc in Nuclear Engineering at the University of 
  California, Berkeley.  There, I am fellow within 
  <a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu">the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS)</a> 
  and a postdoctoral scholar with 
  <a href="https://st.llnl.gov/partnerships/academia-and-gov/nssc">the Nuclear Science and Security Consortium</a>.
  Currenly, I investigate safety and sustainability in advanced nuclear 
  reactors and systems using multiphysics simulation and agent-based modeling, 
  respectively.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, I owe much of my  2008, as a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, I helped to 
  found a peer-instruction group called <a 
    href="https://thehackerwithin.github.io">The Hacker Within</a>.  This group 
  shares many of the same goals as Software Carpentry, conducts weekly meetings 
  for skill-sharing, and, at the University of Wisconsin, conducted occasional 
  large workshops on programming practices and languages. When my PhD advisor, 
  Paul Wilson, introduced us to Greg's Software Carpentry concepts in a video 
  online, we were inspired to create a Software Carpentry workshop on our own. 
  He found out about it online and emailed us.  An incredible friendship was 
  formed and THW material seeded much of the workshop material we are still 
  using today in Software Carpentry.
</p>
<p>
  When Software Carpentry became an independent foundation, I was thrilled to 
  become part of the interim Steering Committee. I served in many ways: by 
  signing the official Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement with NumFocus, electing 
  Greg as our Executive Director, hashing over budgets, advocating Software 
  Carpentry, drafting many of the documents now guiding nascent SCF actions, 
  and much more.
</p>
<p>
  If elected to the 2015 Steering Committee, I would be pleased to take on any 
  role. That said, the role of Secretary would be of most interest to me. I 
  have served successfully as an executive committee member, secretary, 
  treasurer, vice-chair, and chair of many organizations. Some of the 
  organizations that I have helped to lead include The Hacker Within, the 
  American Nuclear Society's Fuel Cycle and Waste Management Division, its 
  Young Members Group, Nuclear Pride, and others. Similarly, I have 
  demonstrated my dedication and efficacy as a community leader through two 
  years as Technical Program Co-Chair of the SciPy scientific python 
  conference. 
</p>
<p>
  As a member of Steering Committee, I will be dedicated to the sustainable 
  growth of the Software Carpentry community, its mission, and its vision. As 
  Damien mentioned in <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/01/scf-nomination-irving.html">his candidacy announcement</a>, 
  this transition period for the SCF will be an important one that will require extraordinary 
  organization, cohesion, and dedication from its Steering Committee members. I intend to 
  give generously of my time, skills, social capital, and enthusiasm as I 
  always have, to move Software Carpentry forward into a strong, sustainble 
  era. 
<p>
</p>
  In particular, if I am elected as Secretary, I hope to emphasize 
  radical transparency in Committee actions and communications. A key role for 
  the committee will be to communicate as effectively, inclusively, and clearly 
  as possible with the Software Carpentry community of instructors, learners, 
  and other stakeholders. In an analogy to open science, I hope to facilitate 
  those goals by ensuring transparent, multi-channel, multi-directional 
  communication among the members of the community in such a way that the 
  Steering Committee hears them and is, itself, heard.
</p>
<p>
  It would be impossible to overemphasize the impact Software Carpentry has had 
  on me as a researcher and a human. In return, I hope to continue to serve 
  this amazing community as a member of the Software Carpentry Steering 
  Committee. For more details, please check out my <a

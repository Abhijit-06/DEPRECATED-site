I would propose three things to the new Committee: <strong>improve our outreach and communication strategies</strong>, <strong>expand Software Carpentry to other regions and languages</strong>, and <strong>strengthen the mentoring program for new instructors</strong>. I&#8217;m an instructor since September 2013 and have taught 10 workshops so far. I&#8217;m finishing a master&#8217;s in Science Communication and work at the <a href="https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging</a>.
</p>
<!-- start excerpt -->

<p>I&#8217;m probably one of the least computer-inclined instructors in the whole pool. Back when I was doing my BSc in Physics in Spain, I didn&#8217;t like computers much. I got my first one as a freshman and the only programming class I took was an awful intro to numerical analysis in FORTRAN.
</p>

<p>Two years in my PhD, I realized computer simulations are handy in real life and that the elegance of the analytical approach comes also with some vacuity (cows are not always spherical, you know). I implemented a Monte Carlo in Mathematica and felt proud. My Russian friend Alexei thought different (<em>&#8220;Mathematica is a black box!&#8221;</em>) and encouraged me to learn a &#8220;real&#8221; programming language. I took a class on C++ and noted that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Generic-Programming-Alexander-Stepanov/dp/0321942043">programming is pretty</a>. </p>

<p>Armed with my new vision and class, I took a postdoc at Oak Ridge National Lab in a computational physics group to work in a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix_renormalization_group">algorithm that gives exact solutions for quantum systems with reduded dimensionality</a>. I also thought that programming would be handy if I <em>ever</em> had to apply for a real job.</p>

<p>After couple of weeks in Oak Ridge, a fellow postdoc handed me a toy C++ implementation of the algorithm. I never told this to anyone, but I spent that day trying to compile it using <code>gcc</code> instead of <code>g++</code>. (Short story, doesn&#8217;t work).</p>

<p><strong>From this start you can imagine the pain.</strong> Countless hours in the vicious cycle of writing buggy code, throwing it to the compiler, which inevitably buried me with errors or seg faults. </p>

<p>I got everything working nicely at some point and became a &#8220;competent programmer&#8221;, but I still doubt whether was worthy.</p>

<p>Years later, I found out Software Carpentry on the web. I started devouring Greg&#8217;s videos and wondering <strong>why nobody had told me all that before</strong>. I learnt lots, realizing I wasn&#8217;t as &#8220;competent&#8221; as I thought. </p>

<p>The truth is many still think that computer skills is something that scientists should get from a pill.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why I would ask the new Committee to <strong>improve our communication strategies</strong>. I think we need to reach out further and to different audiences, not only <strong>scientists</strong> looking to improve their skills, but also <strong>lab managers</strong>, <strong>program administrators</strong>, <strong>university departments</strong>, and <strong>the press</strong>. And maybe to other groups: there had been workshops for librarians, but what about data journalists?</p>

<p><a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/01/scf-nomination-silva.html">As Raniere</a>, I would like to <strong>expand Software Carpentry geographically</strong>. <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/previous.html">Most workshops happen in English-speaking countries</a>, even outside North America: there was a bunch in the UK, but just one in Spain. Sure is because of the awesome people pushing in these places like <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/01/scf-nomination-pawlik.html">Aleksandra</a>, Giacomo or <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/01/scf-nomination-irving.html">Damien</a>.  But I also think that the language barrier comes into play. I&#8217;d like to push translation of Software Carpentry materials, continuing the on-going efforts in Portuguese and Spanish. </p>

<p>Lastly, as many other candidates, I want to <strong>strengthen our mentoring program for new instructors</strong>. When I taught the first times, I felt a disconnect between the intructor training and what&#8217;s needed in a real workshop. Greg and <a href="http://mozillascience.org/instructor-hangouts-landing-this-friday/">Bill Mills</a> are doing great things here, but with more new instructors coming and others teaching after a while, a stronger mentoring program would be beneficial for all.</p>

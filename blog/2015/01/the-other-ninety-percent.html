<p>
  We don't know how much our learners actually start using after a workshop.
  We have some insight thanks to <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6220">Jory Schossau's work</a>,
  but we also know that a lot of people don't know where to go next after they finish with us.
  Most professional programmers turn to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>,
  but it's not novice-friendly:
  many first encounters consist of some variation on,
  "<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM</a>, noob,"
  particularly when the questioner isn't really sure what they're asking.
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<p>
  We've tried a few kinds of follow-up in the past, but:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>local meet-ups</em> petered out quickly as people got busy with other commitments,
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      our two attempts at a <em>forum</em> fizzled as well,
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>online office hours</em> were sparsely attended
      (we often had more people showing up to give help than to get it),
      and
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>IRC</em> isn't something non-nerds are ever likely to adopt
      (something we re-discovered during last summer's sprint).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All of this should be read sceptically,
  though,
  because we were a lot smaller two years ago than we are today.
  People will participate in a group when other people participate;
  the more people there are,
  and the more likely each one is to show up,
  the more likely it is that the next person will get the help (or company) they're looking for.
  With 287 instructors instead of 50,
  and with 10,000 alumni instead of 2500,
  we may finally have the critical mass we need to sustain something.
</p>
<p>
  But we need to be careful about what the "something" is.
  Broadly speaking,
  our learners need two things:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Help with generic software development issues like,
      "How do I recover an old file with Git?"
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Help with things that are specific to their science like,
      "How do I get this tool to display my phylogenetic tree properly?"
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The first is what Stack Overflow is for,
  but again,
  it's only theoretically accessible to novices:
  many of our learners don't know how to phrase their question,
  wouldn't recognize a correct answer if they saw one,
  and have to have thick skins to persist in the face of SO's all-too-frequent rudeness.
  (Cf. <a href="http://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2015/01/abuse-is-not-ok.html">Nick Coghlan's piece on abusing contributors</a>,
  neatly summarized by <a href="https://twitter.com/nslater/status/558342559010127872">Noah Slater</a>.)
</p>
<p>
  I don't know how much we'll be able to help with the second issue in the short run,
  but in the long run I hope our contribution will be to increase the number of people
  who are willing and able to offer technical support.
  To get us from here to there,
  I'd like to explore two new ways of helping workshop alumni implement the ideas we've shown them.
  They will all require effort from our volunteers,
  but again,
  we have a lot more of those than we used to.
  In no particular order:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Mixed-mode teaching</em>,
      with an instructor coming in via video conferencing
      and helpers in the room with learners.
      We've tried this a couple of times with good results;
      wider use would not only eliminates travel time and costs
      (both of which will help us reach more places),
      but also allow us to teach workshops in more digestible ways,
      such as several half-days instead of two full days.
      This will hopefully also allow more follow-up:
      if we cut out travel time,
      instructors might be able to do more teaching with the same number of hours.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Live demos</em>,
      in which instructors webcast as they live-code their way through a short problem.
      The idea here is to show learners what "done" looks like,
      and along the way to teach them things they don't even know to ask for
      (as in, "Cool, I didn't know RStudio could do that").
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  If there are other ideas that you'd like to implement,
  please comment below:
  we'd be happy to experiment.
</p>

<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  A little over a year ago,
  we blogged about <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/09/building-better-teachers.html">jugyokenkyu</a>,
  or "lesson study",
  a bucket of practices that Japanese teachers use to hone their craft,
  from observing each other at work
  to discussing the lesson afterward
  to studying curriculum materials with colleagues.
  Getting the Software Carpentry Foundation up and running almost immediately pushed that aside,
  but now that the SCF is up and running,
  it's time to return to the subject.
  Discussion of <a href="how-teaching-knowledge-is-transferred.html">how teaching practices are transferred</a>
  is part of that;
  so are two other developments this week.
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<p>
  First, Victor Eijkhout has been thinking about
  <a href="https://bitbucket.org/VictorEijkhout/parallel-computing-book/downloads/eijkhout-teachmpi.pdf">how to teach MPI</a>.
  In particular,
  he has been thinking about how the order in which concepts are usually introduced can mislead or confuse,
  and about a different order that leads more naturally to proficient use.
  We're not going to include MPI in Software Carpentry any time soon (if ever),
  but I hope that the next major revision of our lessons will include this kind of design rationale.
</p>
<p>
  Second,
  <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/team.html#bostroem.a">Azalee Bostroem</a> surveyed people who have taught our current Python lesson
  to find out what they're actually doing and how it has been going.
  <a href="python-lesson-survey-results.pdf">The results</a> are fascinating&mdash;here
  are some of the key findings, and my comments:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    60% of our lessons are being taught to novices.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The term "novice" is a bit ambiguous here:
      it can mean either "someone who has never programmed before"
      or "someone who hasn't programmed <em>in Python</em>".
      When we re-design this lesson,
      we could well wind up creating different versions for these audiences,
      since someone who's learning Python as a second language will be able to move faster and farther
      than someone who is new to ideas like "variable", "list", and "function".
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Roughly half of the respondents don't like the way we jump right
    into an example.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The intention was to get to an authentic task as quickly as possible,
      and "load CSV, create plot" is something every scientist does.
      I still think it works for people who are learning Python as a second language,
      but if that's only 1/3 of our workshops,
      it's not surprising that it often doesn't work.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Only 1/3 of respondents got through the whole Python lesson.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Which means we need to cut material&mdash;even if we say,
      "It's OK to go as far as you can,"
      instructors will often feel that they've let their audience down
      if they don't get through it all.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Over 80% of the respondents are teaching our materials with little
    or no modification, but 22% are using an older version.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Based on a handful of conversations,
      I think people use older material because
      (a) they stick to whatever lesson they first taught,
      and/or (b) they don't like the NumPy-early approach of the current lesson.
      I don't know what we can do about (a),
      but our "Python as a first language" lesson
      should start with simpler tasks.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    The defensive programming section which is skipped by over 85% of
    the people who answered the survey, so we should move this
    material elsewhere.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      I (reluctantly) agree,
      at least for people who are learning programming for the first time.
      As with <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/10/why-we-dont-teach-testing.html">testing</a>,
      there's no point putting scarce classroom or maintenance time into something that doesn't stick.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    82% of the people answering the survey are teaching out of the
    Jupyter Notebook.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      I was surprised by that, but I now wonder if it explains why it
      takes so long to get through material with novices, who are
      facing the double cognitive load of a new programming language
      <em>and</em> a new kind of editing interface.  I teach the
      old-fashioned way (scripts run from the command line) to avoid
      this extra load, but clearly it's time for me to change.
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>
  Stepping back,
  the second-greatest benefit of teaching in the large is that
  we can pool our experiences.
  (The greatest is having someone who can genuinely sympathize when something has gone wrong...)
  It would take even our most active instructors several years to learn this much about our lessons;
  comparing notes helps us all improve faster.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  As further data,
  here are comments from this year's instructor debriefing sessions
  related to teaching Python.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/01/instructor-debriefing-2015-01-27.html">2015-01-27</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Tried to make the Python materials a bit more bespoke to be
    relevant to our attendees. For example, I did a session on
    creating maps using Basemap and plotting data onto them. For one
    session, I used a very short set of slides to introduce session
    objectives and to summarize.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/02/instructor-debriefing-2015-02-10.html">2015-02-10</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A couple of points were made about teaching with the IPython
    Notebook. First, it doesn't show as much history on screen at one
    time as (for example) the Bash shell, so it's harder for learners
    to follow what's going on. Second, Neal Davis said that he found
    it much better to start with an empty notebook and grow it cell by
    cell rather than opening up one that already had code in it and
    replaying it.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/02/instructor-debriefing-2015-02-24.html">2015-02-24</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The instructor started with the &quot;inflammation&quot;
    material, then used his own examples to place more emphasis on
    &quot;for&quot; loops and &quot;if&quot; statements (e.g. nested
    for loops). At the end, the participants were given the challenge
    of printing prime numbers in the [2,100] range to the screen. Two
    participants commented that the example was too
    &quot;mathematical&quot;. The participants enjoyed the
    instructors' funny anecdotes. From quick feedback, almost equal
    number found the pace &quot;too fast&quot; as did &quot;too
    slow&quot;, which not all the unusual for workshops with a mix of
    novice and advanced participants.</p>
    <p>Basic Python (data type, variable, list, file stream) was
    taught using more introductory lessons rather than the standard
    software carpentry materials. The audience are mostly biologists
    with no experience in Python or Git. 4/15 had some experience with
    the Unix shell. The instructors tried to make the materials as
    introductory as possible. They felt that the Python materials on
    the Software Carpentry GitHub repo were not basic enough for the
    audience and that some introduction to basic Python data types was
    necessary.</p>
    <p>Things worked well overall. They spent some time explaining the
    difference between shell (Bash), Python in the shell, and IPython
    Notebook, as some participants were confused about these concepts
    before. Both Python in the shell and IPython Notebook were used
    during the Python lessons. Hand-on exercises for participants
    worked really well. When students were not interactive, the TAs
    helped out by posing questions to the instructors. Some
    participants expressed that there was not enough discussion prior
    to the hands-on exercises and that they had no idea how to
    start. Jirong mentioned that more exercise collections in the repo
    would be nice.</p>

    <p>Users wanted some clear direction on post-workshop python
    learning materials (forums, websites, etc.).</p>
    <p>The Python notebooks were a mixed bag: users appreciated a
    demonstration of some scripting in an IDE (used Spyder). Also need
    to clear run cells in the IPython Notebooks before teaching;
    probably best to commit the notebooks to the workshop repo in a
    cleared state.</p>

    <p><em>Teaching R and Python together:</em> University of
    Melbourne ambitiously covered Unix, Git, SQL, Python and R over a
    three day workshop. Although they reported some learning fatigue
    near the end, the lesson pacing was appropriate and they received
    largely positive feedback. R and RStudio were taught first,
    followed by Python and a short introduction to Jupyter Notebook,
    which allowed instructors to highlight parallels between the
    scripting language and their respective interfaces.</p>
    <p><em>Crafting material to particular audiences:</em> Several
    instructors noted difficulty in meeting the particular skill
    levels of their students. In one case, the R material seemed too
    advanced, so instructors substituted modified Data Carpentry
    material. On the other hand, challenge questions for
    shell/Git/Python appeared too easy for students in other
    workshops. Several lessons were not completed because of time
    constraints; cutting lesson material to fit the workshop is a
    continuing problem for instructors. However, multiple instructors
    noted the usefulness of domain-specific datasets, and the
    University of Oklahoma group supplemented their lessons on Unix,
    Python, and Git with specific discussions of library data
    (MARC).</p>

    <p>The only relevant comment about Python is that using IPython
    Notebook with Git is still challenging.</p>

    <p>For difficulties, both Git and Python instructors found
    themselves wishing for more challenge questions. Specifically for
    Python, it was the longing for more multiple choice
    questions. These are especially useful tools to quickly probe your
    teaching and students learning, and gives you a chance to uncover
    any misconceptions that arose during a lesson. Thus, if anyone has
    any spare time and has Git or Python expertise - please help us
    out by creating some new challenge material for these lessons
    (especially of the multiple choice format) and submit them as a
    pull request.</p>
    <p>Instructors from Oklahoma State University synced their iPython
    notebook to a Dropbox share translated
    by <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org">nbviewer</a>. They found
    that this really worked well for students who fell behind and
    needed to see code that was no longer on the instructors screen to
    catch-up, as well as for those students who wanted to review what
    had been covered. If Python is taught across two days, the
    instructor can also clean up the notebook before the start of the
    second day so all students can start at the same place with
    working code.</p>

    <p>While instructors can almost always expect a few installation
    problems at a given workshop, some instructors noted particular
    problems with Python. In particular, students with a previous
    installation of Python may not have installed Anaconda, either
    because they did not know it was necessary, or did not want to
    &quot;lose&quot; their previous installation. Instructors can help
    by informing students of the necessity of particular
    installations, and how to switch between versions. University of
    Basque Country actually hosted a short installations session the
    day before the workshop to help students with such issues.</p>

    <p>The UC Berkeley workshop had 26 participants split evenly
    between life and physical sciences. The workshop covered shell,
    Python and Git. The python sections were done for version 3, based
    on <a href="https://bids.github.io/2015-06-04-berkeley/">Katy
    Huff's June 4 workshop</a>. The testing section on the second day
    felt rushed.</p>

    <p>In particular, we talked about the benefits of slowly
    introducing concepts in Python and R compared to jumping right
    into advanced topics and explaining mechanisms as the lessons
    progressed. For example,
    the <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder">R
    gapminder lesson</a> can start with impressive, powerful packages
    like dplyr and tidyR to motivate students. However, this can be
    confusing to students new to programming, and will require
    backtracking later in the lesson to explain more basic
    concepts. This problem is can sometimes be alleviated by
    appropriately contextualizing the point of the lesson (i.e.,
    automation of work, rather than learning how every algorithm
    works). Conversations about these issues are ongoing on GitHub and
    in various listservs (see
    the <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation/issues/127">novice
    Python lesson</a> for an example).</p>
    <p>Figuring out how to trim down copious lesson materials to fit
    the alloted time for a class continues to be problematic,
    especially for the Python and R materials (but see below). We
    recommend that experienced instructors partnered with new
    instructors for upcoming workshops share their thoughts about how
    to cut out sections of lessons. New instructors can also contact
    the mentoring subcommittee for assistance in selecting
    material.</p>
    <p>While having too much material for a topic included in the
    lessons can be a burden on instructors, the advantage is being
    able to more carefully cater the lesson to the
    audience. Instructors from SciPy, for example, included
    introductions to the packages NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and
    matplotlib, because students were likely to encounter these later
    in the conference. More information about these lessons were
    written up in
    a <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/07/scipy-2015.html">previous
    blog post</a>.</p>

    <p>We are also still seeking an effective method for helping
    students stay on track during the Python lessons, as commands
    entered move up and off the demo screen with graphical and text
    output in iPython notebooks.</p>

    <p>Enhancing workshops with domain-specific examples</p>
    <p>The helpers also provided
    a <a href="http://wiki.scipy.org/NumPy_for_Matlab_Users">&quot;NumPy
    for Matlab Users&quot; resource</a> to help make the Matlab to
    Python transition a little bit easier.</p>
    <p>Byron Smith reorganized the flow of the Python lesson but kept
    many of the same details from the lessons for
    the <a href="http://bsmith89.github.io/2015-08-27-unh">UNH
    workshop</a>. Additionally, one learner suggested splitting up the
    monolithic Jupyter Notebook into smaller pieces, which would clean
    up the namespace and gave learners a more manageable set of
    &quot;notes&quot;. There have been many discussions on the Python
    lessons lately, including these blogs.</p>

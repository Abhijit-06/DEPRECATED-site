    introspection
  </a>
  regarding Software Carpentry's Python lesson has led us to conclude that
  the lesson would benefit from a complete rewrite.
  The subcommittee on lesson development met twice to plan much about the
  new lessons (yes, that's plural).
  This post will describe our plans for the new lessons.
</p>
<p>
  We're going to write two new Python lessons, one intended for students who
  are completely new to programming (the "novice" lesson),
  and another for students with some programming experience (the "intermediate" lesson).
  <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a> also targets
  new programmers so we'll be developing the new novice lesson in collaboration
  with DC, and both DC and SWC will use the lesson.
  We decided to use <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/">Gapminder</a> data
  for both the novice and intermediate lessons in order to have a
  consistent experience and approachable, meaningful data
  (and because some lessons are already using it).

<h2>Novice Lesson</h2>
<p>
  The overarching goal of the novice lesson is to convince students to adopt
  programming in their everyday work flow.
  To do that we want to both teach practical data tools
  and demonstrate the power of writing code (instead of using Excel).
  Our lesson will include using <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>
  to work with data and using Python's
  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html">control flow features</a>
  to really make the computer work.

  Greg Wilson will be leading the development of the new lesson.

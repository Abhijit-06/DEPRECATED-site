* in-person in Manchester
* multi-week fully-distributed
  * meeting every week instead of every second week (like we've done in the past)
  * 54 started, 48 stayed with us 'til the end (highest completion rate we've had in two years)
  * used Piazza for managing the class - not noticeably better than a shared WordPress blog, but easier on many people than our experiment with GitHub earlier this year
  * used BlueJeans for meetings (each meeting held twice to accommodate time zones - BlueJeans mostly worked, but sometimes had trouble with # of participants)
  * started training other trainers (plus a guest speaker - hi, Sarah
* two-day group-based
  * 9 groups handled by 4 trainers  (1 / 3 / 2 / 3 groups per instructor based primarily on geography)
  * team sizes were:
    * Townsville: 4
    * Potsdam + Paris + Thessaloniki: ??
    * Toronto (14) + Curitiba (3) = 17
    * Wisconsin + Arlington + Vancouver: ??
  * used one Google Hangout for each of the four groups
    * occasional glitches, but mostly reliable
    * DDoS attack on UK academic networks didn't help - lots of things inaccessible, but we managed
* overall
  * mostly positive, and certainly less total effort for instructors than the multi-week version
  * some participants may have been less enthusiastic than usual (roped in by friends to get numbers)
  * not much inter-group discussion (sessions tended to be hub-and-spoke with the trainer as the hub)
  * harder to give good feedback (esp. on practice teaching) over the web than in person
  * The live coding was a really good exercise, I think particularly for the more experienced coders - made them slow down
* individual
  * Greg:
    * mornings went better than afternoons
      * that's always the case, but being 5 hours ahead of one of my groups meant I was teaching in my afternoon and evening
  * Fiona:
    * online live course made a lot more use of the Etherpad, which meant there were collaboratively-produced resource at the end
    * I did the demotivational stories and the 'thought exercise' (challenging negative thoughts as a way of addressing impostor syndrome)
      and on both occasions had someone decline to share with the group.
      I prodded a bit but then let them go, which I thought was best.

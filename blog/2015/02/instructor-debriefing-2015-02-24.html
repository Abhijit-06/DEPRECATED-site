<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  We had our fourth post-workshop debriefing of the year this week,
  in which we discussed recent workshops in .
  The most important point was probably that
  workshops are running more smoothly today
  than they did a year ago,
  even for first-time instructors.

General notes:
backup LTE router is a neat idea :)
one helper was feeding etherpad with informations - which was very good
"quick feedback" - after each part (shell, python, git, sql) we collected pros and cons on the stickynotes - really good idea
specific to Polish - switching to direct, informal form "Ty"(You) instead of "Pan/Pani" (Sir/Madam) which is not typical for our language (in the academia teachers are supposed to use "Sir/Madam" form, so are learners - it makes lectures more formal) This is something positive.
41 people registered, almost everyone showed up (in fact 36), several people (7 of them) didn't come at Sunday (they were to advanced to be interested)
sticky notes (especially red one for informing about problems) were well received 

Piotr Banaszkiewicz: basic Software Carpentry git lesson

git was taught accordingly to Software Carpentry lesson
I did not use pair programming (or pair-githubbing)
I used (thanks to Leszek and one of our helpers) this handout http://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf - a GitHub cheat sheet for git
most of the participants really liked it, some negative comments pointed out that the lesson doesn't include commands from that cheatsheet and suggested we should prepare a better one that closely follows our lesson plan
a quick poll showed that 14 people want pair-githubbing out of 22 notes collected
good pace
Shell:
used stock  "inflammation" material 
managed to teach form beginning to lesson about loops (so 5 lessons was covered)
Results from sticky notes feedback:
people were pleased with quizzes at the ending of each lesson (especially multiple choice questions)
they liked ether pad notes taken during lessons
some people was disappointed that we didn't get to building shell scripts

Python notes:
 - at the beginning - stock "inflammation" material
 - then I tried to put more stress on "for" and "if"s (eg. nested for loops) with my own examples
 - very time limited (1/2 of a day)
 - at the end small task for participants: print prime numbers on screen in [2,100] range
 - as a result - two people commented that it was to "mathematical"
Results from quick feedback:
 - 3 people - too difficult
 - 4 people - too easy
 - funny anecdotes were good :)

SQL:
- technical issues at the beginning
- used Firefox plugin instead of "pure" shell
- too short




Jiarong: Intro python (Beacon center at Michigan State U on 2015-01-28)

Taught basic python (data type, variable, list, file stream) with anther instructor. The other two topics are Shell and GIt. Four hours were spent on each topics from 8:30am - 12:30pm and break is at 10:15am. 

The audience are mostly biologist and have no experience about  python and git, only 4 out of 15 have experience about bash. So we tried to make the materials as introductory as possible. The python materials on SWC git repo is not basic enough to our audience, so we tried to find materials on internet. We think some introduction to basic python data type is necessary but the SWC python lesson focus on the problem and started from NumPy that might be too much for our students.

Things worked well: 1) we spent some time explaining the difference between Shell (Bash), python shell, and ipython notebook. Both python shell and ipython notebook were used during lesson. I heard students confused about these concepts before. 2) The exercise session worked really well. 3) Let TA ask questions when students are not interactive.

Things does worked well: I forgot to let the students to discuss a little before they started to code. Some students complain that they have no idea how to start.

Some exercise collection in the repo would be nice.

<p>
  It's been quite a year for Software Carpentry instructor training:
  we had <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/01/instructor-training-at-uc-davis.html">a great session at UC Davis</a>
  (see also <a href="http://neuro.plos.org/2015/02/12/effective-teaching-tips-from-a-train-the-trainers-workshop/">this excellent post</a>
  from Rayna Harris)
  and another at
  <a href="http://melbourne.resbaz.edu.au/post/110950818524/software-carpentry-set-to-explode-in-aus-nz">the Research Bazaar kickoff</a>
  in Melbourne.
  We've also started
  <a href="{{site.github_io_url}}/training-course/submissions/round-12/index.html">the twelfth round of online instructor training</a>
  with 75 participants,
  making it our largest yet.
</p>
<p>
  All of this has led to
  <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/02/weekly-update-2015-02-b13.html#stats-2015-02-13">a flurry of activity</a>
  in our GitHub repositories.
  The comments and pull requests are very welcome,
  but we need to keep three things in mind:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      We already have more material than we can cover in two days.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We are not our learners.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      No lesson survives its first presentation intact.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<p>
  The first point is the most difficult.
  Everyone can think of things we ought to teach;
  the hard part is agreeing on <em>what to take out</em> to make room for those additions.
  For example,
  I really want to include dictionaries in our basic Python tutorial,
  but I'm damned if I can figure out what it's greater than,
  i.e.,
  what to drop to free up the half hour it takes for people to learn
  what they and how they work.
</p>
<p>
  The common response when I say that (as I have several times in the last few days)
  is, "Half an hour?  It only takes a minute!"
  And that brings us to the second point:
  we are not our learners.
  The people who are most likely to offer contributions to lessons
  are the ones who are most confident in their computing skills.
  That does not necessarily imply they are the most competent,
  but it does (usually) mean that they already understand these ideas,
  and therefore under-estimate how hard they are for newcomers.
  In particular,
  they under-estimate how often "little" things will go wrong in incomprehensible ways.
  and how hard they are to fix without a working mental model of how all this stuff works.
</p>
<p>
  For example,
  the first exercise for this round of instructor training was
  to submit a short biography
  as a pull request to <a href="{{site.github_io_url}}/training-course/">our GitHub-hosted blog</a>.
  After his was merged,
  one trainee got this error message from Jekyll
  (the page translation tool GitHub uses):
</p>
<pre>
Liquid Exception: comparison of Jekyll::Document with Jekyll::Document failed in _layouts/roundindex.html
jekyll 2.4.0 | Error:  comparison of Jekyll::Document with Jekyll::Document failed
</pre>
<p>
  That's it&mdash;no file name, much less a line number.
  Here's the header of the offending file:
</p>
<pre>
---
date: 20150201
round: Round 12
title: About Some Body
author: Some Body
permalink: /2015/02/some-body/

Some Body is a theological engineer working at...
</pre>
<p>
  The problem is the date:
  it has to be hyphenated as <code>2015-02-01</code>,
  but good luck figuring that out from the error message.
  Another trainee's post didn't produce any error message all&mdash;it just
  didn't show up in the blog.
  Her header looked like this:
</p>
<pre>

round: Round 12

Hi!  I'm Somebody Else, and...
</pre>
<p>
  It took me about five minutes to notice that the "---" closing the header is indented,
  which means that Jekyll decides the page is all header and no body
  and throws it away.
</p>
<p>
  My point here isn't to complain about Jekyll
  (although c'mon&mdash;not even a file name?).
  My point is that what we're trying to teach is hard,
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">accidental complexity</a> imposed by lousy tools makes it harder,
  and it's all too easy for people who've climbed a hill to forget how steep it was and say,
  "But [Topic X] will only take a couple of minutes."
</p>
<p>
  Which brings us to the third point:
  no lesson survives its first presentation intact.
  Over the past four months,
  several instructors have used material of their own in workshops.
  Sometimes it's gone well;
  sometimes, though, it hasn't,
  and when it hasn't,
  it's usually been because it was just too much to digest.
</p>
<p>
  My <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/02/nouns-and-verbs.html">previous musings on teaching</a>
  didn't end with anything actionable,
  so this one should.
  I'd like to propose that:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Every time someone suggests a substantial addition to one of our lessons,
      we have to figure out what's going to be removed to make room for it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Every time someone wants to teach their own material in a workshop,
      they have to post it for review at least a week before they use it
      so that other instrutors can give them feedback.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  I don't want either rule to scare people off or strangle progress,
  but I also think that as more instructors and other potential contributors join us,
  we need some guidelines around lesson development.
  Our previous idea&mdash;voting on changes at each lab meeting&mdash;proved unworkable,
  and while our <a href="{{page.root}}/lessons.html#maintainers">topic maintainers</a>
  have been doing a great job reviewing and merging pull requests,
  both they and our contributors would like more structure.
  I'd be grateful for feedback on whether these ideas are (a) good and (b) workable&mdash;please
  add them as comments on this blog post,
  and I'll summarize next week.
</p>

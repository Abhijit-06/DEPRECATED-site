<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  During last week Steering Committee meeting we talk about applying
  to Google Summer of Code as a mentoring organization
  and we decide to contact NumFOCUS suggesting that they
  applying as a umbrella organization for
  <a href="http://numfocus.org/projects/index.html">all the projects they support</a>.
  NumFOCUS agreed on that and in the past few days
  we are running to fill the application.

  projects. Instructions to how became a mentor or suggest one project
  are <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/gsoc2015/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#mentors">available here</a>.

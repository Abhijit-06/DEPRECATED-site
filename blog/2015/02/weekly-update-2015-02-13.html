    Greg posted a SWC-related <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/02/plot-this.html">visualisation challenge</a> and got some interesting suggestions.(Question: given the dataset, draw a scatter plot comparing workshop attendees per capita to instructors per capita).  Do you want to turn Andrew Abela's guide to visualisation into a halfday SWC lesson? Please <a href="mailto:admin@software-carpentry.org">get in touch</a>.

     The <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/02/instructor-debriefing-2015-02-10.html">third post-workshop debriefing</a> evaluated several workshops where mostly R was taught. A few issues were discussed including the benefits of having a single data set that runs through all of the lessons. This will be discussed in an upcoming lab meeting.

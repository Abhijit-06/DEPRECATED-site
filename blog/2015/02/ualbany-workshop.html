  We recently ran a workshop hosted by the University at Albany, SUNY  
  <a href="http://www.albany.edu/informatics/">Department of Informatics</a>.
  The workshop ran on the weekend of January 31 and February 1, 2015 with
  the following schedule:

  <em>Thomas:</em>The welcome we received from the University at Albany Department of Informatics staff was fantastic.
  They looked into every single detail and did a great job taking care of the instructors during the
  entire weekend. As a new instructor (it was my third time teaching and first time teaching bash) with very
  little teaching experience outside of Software Carpentry, this created the perfect atmosphere for me to
  relax a little and focus on delivering the lesson. Being paired with a more seasoned instructor (Jeramia) was
  also very useful, and we used the breaks to give each other feedback and report on how the class was following and
  which were the topics with with some attendees seemed to have issues and warranted being mentioned again.

	Another thing that I learned the hard way was that if I don't know the answer to a question straight away,
	I'm better off admitting that I would need some time researching it, doing so during the next break, and then
	coming up with an answer, rather than try to look up the information online live and trying multiple options
	until I found a solution. While it does demystifies the process and highlights the approach of looking up
	answers to specific questions on the Web (which I believe is an important part of learning to code), it makes
	me too nervous and ends up being unproductive. Maybe with more experience I'll get better at adlibbing.

	On Saturday, the organisers had invited Mike XXXX, a social science researcher currently working for Facebook,
	to give a prep talk to attendees (some of which were recent Social Sciences graduates) about the importance
	of basic programming skills and knowledge of tools like R in their profession. I found it to be an interesting
	addition to the workshop, clearly a good way to link the syllabus with real-life examples. On the flip side, it
	also meant that most attendees didn't take a proper break over lunch, which had effects on their attention in
	the afternoon. Maybe something to keep in mind when discussing future workshops with organisers.

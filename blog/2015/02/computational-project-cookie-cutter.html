<p>
  I was first introduced to a paper by William Stafford Noble published in PLOS
  Computational Biology in 2009 titled
  <a href='http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424'>'A
  Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects'</a> back when Ivan
  Gonzalez and I taught Harvard last November.  Noble writes about how
  scientists in Computational Biology should setup their project folders so
  code, results, outputs, figures, and papers are all in easily understandable
  locations.  He also writes about how one should run experiments (using driver
  scripts) to make workflows reproducible, readable, and understandable to
  others (and your future self).

I recently reorganized a project I was working on to follow Nobe's folder
structure, and when I started a new computational project, I realized I would
have to create the same folder structure again.  Since, we're in the business of
not repeating ourselves, I created a short bash script that implements the basic
folder structure outlined by Noble
<a href='https://github.com/chendaniely/computational-project-cookie-cutter'>here</a>.
When I brought up the project to our discussion board, Pat Scholass chimed in
with a similar project based on the same motivational
paper <a href='https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-init'>here</a>,
and my project even got a pull request!

Cookie cutter projects are
<a href='https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter'>quite</a>
<a href='http://projecttemplate.net/'>common</a>.  What is a cookie cutter?
Essentially they are pre-built templates for project that follow some kind of
convention.  Folder structures, and basic boiler plate code, are examples I've
given.

For software carpentry, it serves as a way for us to teach our attendees some
<a href='http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745'>best
practices</a>.  While showing them the importance of reproducibility and
scripts.  It also allows a low barrier of entry to actually set up a project
folder structure, since re-organizing folders when a project is fully developed
will most likely not happen.

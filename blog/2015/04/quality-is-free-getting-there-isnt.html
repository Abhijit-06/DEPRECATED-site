  Worried about the rising tide of retractions,
  <em>Nature Biotechnology</em>
  <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/rule-rewrite-aims-to-clean-up-scientific-software-1.17323">recently announced</a> that,
  "Its peer reviewers will now be asked to assess the availability of documentation and algorithms used in computational analyses,
  not just the description of the work.
  The journal is also exploring whether peer reviewers can test complex code..."
  That's a welcome step in theory,
  but I worry about how it will play out in practice.
  Scientists already complain about how much time they spend reviewing papers.
  If they have to review code as well

  "Success in data science will require championing education and training at all levels, with a focus on people."

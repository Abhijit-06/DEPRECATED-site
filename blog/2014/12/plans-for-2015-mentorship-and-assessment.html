  The <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/12/plans-for-2015-instructor-training.html">previous</a>
  <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/12/plans-for-2015-workshop-organization.html">posts</a>
  in this set looked at instructor training and workshop organization.
  In this one,
  I'd like to look at two challenges we need desperately need to address in the coming year:
  mentorship and assessment.
</p>
<p>
  Azalee Bostroem did <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/09/more-thoughts-on-better-teachers.html">a great job summarizing</a>
  why we need to mentor our new instructors
  (and keep those who've been with us a while up to date with changes to our lessons and procedures).
  The question is, how?
  Or more precisely,
  where will the hours come from?
  I said in September that I would organize a weekly meeting for instructors from recent and upcoming workshops.
  Only one took place,
  and saying "we just need to try harder"
  won't solve anything&mdash;I've been doing this job long enough now to know that
  the hours mentorship needs won't ever be available,
  and planning otherwise is just sprinkling magic fairy dust on the problem.
</p>
<p>
  The same is true of assessment.
  Jory Schossau has done valuable service
  <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6220">analyzing survey data and interviewing bootcamp participants</a>,
  and Daniel Chen and others are working hard to
  <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/11/revised-instructor-survey.html">revise the instructors' post-workshop questionnaire</a>,
  but despite several attempts,
  we haven't found anyone willing to fund a systematic look at
  what we're actually doing and what impact it's having.
  Once again,
  we can either pretend that sprinkling magic fairy dust on the problem will make it go away,
  or come up with an alternative plan.
</p>

<p>
  The alternative I'd like to see ties back to our new bylaws.
  Broadly speaking,
  a <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/12/scf-governance.html#board-of-directors">Board of Directors</a>
  can be either active or passive,
  i.e.,
  its members can either do the work needed to actually run the operation,
  or check in once in a while to make sure it's being run properly.
</p>
<p>
  The boards of most open source foundations are activist,
  and ours will be too.
  People who are elected to the Board will be expected to volunteer 2-3 hours a week
  to manage specific things,
  and I would like two of those things to be overseeing mentorship and running assessment.
  It's not a small commitment&mdash;over the course of a year,
  it will be equivalent to a couple or three weeks of work&mdash;but
  that's what keeps organizations like the Python Software Foundation running.

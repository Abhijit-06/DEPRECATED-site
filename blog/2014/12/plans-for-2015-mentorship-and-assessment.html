  The <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/12/plans-for-2015-instructor-training.html">previous</a>
  <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/12/plans-for-2015-workshop-organization.html">posts</a>
  in this set looked at instructor training and workshop organization.
  In this one,
  I'd like to look at mentorship and assessment,
  which are two of the biggest challenges we need need to address in the coming year,
  and are good examples of the kinds of tasks that Board members will be asked to take on.
</p>
<p>
  Azalee Bostroem did <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/09/more-thoughts-on-better-teachers.html">a great job summarizing</a>
  why we need to mentor our new instructors
  (and keep those who've been with us a while up to date with changes to our lessons and procedures).
  The question is, how?
  Or more precisely,
  where will the hours come from?
  I said in September that I would organize a weekly meeting for instructors from recent and upcoming workshops.
  Only one took place,
  and saying "we just need to try harder"
  won't solve anything&mdash;I've been doing this job long enough now to know that
  the hours that proper mentorship needs won't ever be available.
</p>
<p>
  The same is true of assessment.
  Jory Schossau has done valuable service
  <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6220">analyzing survey data and interviewing bootcamp participants</a>,
  and Daniel Chen and others are working hard to
  <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/11/revised-instructor-survey.html">revise the instructors' post-workshop questionnaire</a>,
  but despite several attempts,
  we haven't found anyone willing to fund a systematic look at
  what we're actually doing and what impact it's having.
  Once again,
  we can either pretend that sprinkling magic fairy dust on the problem will make it go away,
  or come up with an alternative plan.
</p>

<p>
  That plan ties back to our new bylaws.
  Broadly speaking,
  a <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/12/scf-governance.html#board-of-directors">Board of Directors</a>
  can be either active or passive,
  i.e.,
  its members can either do the work needed to actually run the operation,
  or check in once in a while to make sure it's being run properly.
</p>
<p>
  Most open source foundations have activist boards,
  and so will we.
  People who are elected to the Board will be expected to volunteer 2-3 hours a week
  to manage specific things,
  and I would like two of those things to be overseeing mentorship and running assessment.
  In particular,
  I hope that one board member will organize a half-hour call each week
  in which recent and upcoming instructors can talk about what's working (or isn't) in our lessons,
  while another will keep the post-workshop assessment questionnaire up to date,
  analyze the data we collect from it,
  and poke instructors to make sure they actually fill it in.
</p>
<p>
  Doing all of this is not a small commitment,
  but we're no longer a small organization,
  and it would be foolish to pretend that what worked in the small
  can work in the large.
  A dozen people are already serving as
  <a href="{{page.root}}/lessons.html#maintainers">maintainers for specific topics</a>,
  and I hope that formalizing our governance will make it easier for others to play a larger role as well.

  Instructor training has been going well:
  it looks like more than 50% of people who participated this summer and fall
  will complete and start teaching for us,
  which is a new record.
  What's even better is that
  we have 136 people signed up for the next online course.
  Even if only half of them complete,
  it will enlarge the pool of instructors by more than a third,
  and broaden our coverage both geographically and across disciplines.
</p>
<p>
  The question now is when that course should start.
  Teaching a group that size will take two full days a week,
  which is more than I can commit to unpaid.
  (I've been without a salary since finishing my contract with Mozilla at the end of October.)
  In the short term,
  I need to focus on building partnerships and getting grant applications out the door
  so that I can spend the rest of the year concentrating on
  the things I <em>should</em> be doing.

  But thinking about it like that is actually a big mistake.
  Any startup,
  whether it's a for-profit company or a non-profit like the SCF,
  has to figure out how it's going to sustain itself in the long run,
  or it won't <em>have</em> a long run.
  It's important to train more instructors,
  but it's just as important to finish revising our curriculum,
  set up an assessment program,
  build some kind of web-based tool for administering workshops,
  and a dozen other things.
  All of these require long periods of unbroken concentration;
  that's what stable funding actually buys,
  so securing it definitely <em>is</em> something I should be doing.
</p>
<p>
  I'm therefore pushing the start of the next online instructor training course
  back to February 2015.
  Doing so will free up eight days in January,
  which I will use to finish getting the SCF's finances in order
  and clean up things that current and freshly-minted instructors have been tripping over.
  We will still go ahead with the live runs of instructor training
  at UC Davis and the University of Melbourne
  in January and February as planned,
  and I hope we'll be able to start the next-but-one run of online training in May.
  By then,
  we should have at least one more instructor trainer up and running,
  and two more partially trained,
  which will help ensure that future courses stay on schedule.

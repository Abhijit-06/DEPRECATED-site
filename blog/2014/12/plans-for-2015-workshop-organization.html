  As I write this,
  228 people have been certified to teach Software Carpentry workshops,
  of whom 136 have taught in the past twelve months.
  That's amazing,
  but as I said in <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/11/where-the-time-goes.html">a previous post</a>,
  growth in one part of a pipeline inevitably turns another into a bottleneck.
  In our case,
  that bottleneck is organizational:
  <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/team.html#collins.arliss">Arliss Collins</a>
  and <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/team.html#peru.giacomo">Giacomo Peru</a>
  are stretched to the limit handling requests and lining up instructors,
  and we're still not keeping up with demand.
</p>
<p>
  This kind of work can't be done by a volunteers in bits and pieces:
  the startup overheads are significant,
  as is the context required to manage each converation,
  and there are time when mail really needs to be answered right now,
  not when it's convenient.
  On the other hand,
  it doesn't require any programming skills
  (and if we ever get a web-based administration tool built,
  people won't even need to know how to do <code>git push</code> and <code>git pull</code>).
</p>
<p>
  To meet this need,
  we ask our <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/12/scf-membership.html#partner">Partners</a>
  to organize workshops in their region.
  We're also hoping that others will shoulder some of the burden as well.
  If your organization is able to commit half a day or more a week to the cause,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">get in touch</a>:
  it would help us just as much as new lessons.

One thing I forgot to mention in yesterday's sessions: if you really want to dig deeper into educational research and how it applies to teaching programming, you should grab a copy of Juha Sorva's PhD thesis from http://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2012/isbn9789526046266/isbn9789526046266.pdf. The UUhistle system he built and field-tested is interesting, but what's _really_ great is the introductory third of the thesis where he summarizes ed psych research - I've extracted that part to http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/sorva-thesis-1.pdf. Very highly recommended....

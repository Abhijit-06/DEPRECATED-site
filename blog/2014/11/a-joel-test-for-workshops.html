  Back during the first dot-com bubble,
  Joel Spolsky an article titled
  <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">"The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code"</a>
  that listed 12 questions you can ask to estimate the maturity of a software development team:

<!-- end excerpt -->
<ol>
  <li>Do you use source control?</li>
  <li>Can you make a build in one step?</li>
  <li>Do you make daily builds?</li>
  <li>Do you have a bug database?</li>
  <li>Do you fix bugs before writing new code?</li>
  <li>Do you have an up-to-date schedule?</li>
  <li>Do you have a spec?</li>
  <li>Do programmers have quiet working conditions?</li>
  <li>Do you use the best tools money can buy?</li>
  <li>Do you have testers?</li>
  <li>Do new candidates write code during their interview?</li>
  <li>Do you do hallway usability testing? </li>
</ol>

  It's completely unscientific,
  but it was also very useful and influential
  (and was in fact one of the inspirations for our
  <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001745">"Best Practices for Scientific Computing"</a>
  paper).
  In that spirit,
  I would like to present a 'Joel Test' for estimating the maturity of
  a scientific computing training team (like us):

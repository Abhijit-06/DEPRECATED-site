<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  Amdahl's Law says that the speedup you can get by parallelizing a computation
  is limited by how much of the computational can't be sped up.
  For example,
  if 10% of a program's run time is inherently sequential,
  then even if you have an infinite number of processors,
  you can't speed it up more than 10 times.
</p>
<p>
  It's becoming clear that the same is true of organizations like Software Carpentry.
  We now have almost 200 certified instructors;
  working in pairs,
  and each teaching only once a year,
  that's already enough to run two workshops a week,
  and we're training more all the time.
  But someone has to train them,
  and match them with workshops,
  and design new templates for lessons,
  and talk to potential sponsors,
  and those central activities are now the biggest constraint on what we can accomplish.

  To give you some idea of the scale of those activities,
  here's what a typical week looks like
  here at Software Carpentry Central:

  That's 57.5 hours
  in a week that <em>doesn't</em> include any travel or teaching,
  and in which I didn't contribute to extracting history from our existing lesson repository,
  building a tool to check that new lessons conform to our style guide,
  follow up on Raniere's experiments with a better build system for lessons,
  complete the ethics training needed for the language comparison study,
  help Gabriel figure out how we're going to handle translations of our lessons,
  and&mdash;but you get the point.
  Things that are vital
  to the long-term health and growth of Software Carpentry
  aren't being done,
  and can't be done until there are more staff.
</p>
<p>
  (And no, "get volunteers from the community to do it" isn't a solution.
  Many of these activities are administrative,
  have long lead times,
  and require sustained attention over a period of months.
  Our volunteers are doing a great job of delivering and refining lessons,
  but it's not realistic to expect them to talk to NSERC on our behalf.)
</p>
<p>
  Our "host pays costs" model will allow workshops to scale indefinitely,
  but coordination at the center needs to increase as well,
  even if not proportionately.
  We therefore need to raise money not only to pay my salary,
  but also to hire at least one more full-time person to share the load.
  We also need to partner with more institutions who can provide staff time
  for coordinating workshops
  in the way that Arliss and Giacomo have been doing.
  While individual donations will help,
  and are very welcome (there's a link at the bottom of this page),
  it's vital that we build institutional ties as well.
  If your organization would be interested in helping us help scientists,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.board_inquiries}}">give us a shout</a>.

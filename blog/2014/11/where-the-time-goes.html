<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  Amdahl's Law says that the speedup you can get by parallelizing a computation
  is limited by how much of the computational can't be sped up.
  For example,
  if 10% of a program's run time is inherently sequential,
  then even if you have an infinite number of processors,
  you can't speed it up more than 10 times.
</p>
<p>
  The same rule applies to organizations like Software Carpentry.
  We now have almost 200 certified instructors;
  even working in pairs,
  and each teaching only once a year,
  that's enough to run two workshops a week,
  and we're training more all the time.
  But someone has to train them,
  and match them with workshops,
  and design new templates for lessons,
  and talk to potential sponsors,
  and those central activities are now constraining what we can accomplish.

  To give you some idea of what goes on behind the scenes,
  here's what my typical week looks like:

<p>
  That's 57.5 hours
  in a week that <em>doesn't</em> include any travel or teaching,
  and in which I didn't contribute to extracting history from our existing lesson repository,
  building a tool to check that new lessons conform to our style guide,
  follow up on experiments with a better build system for lessons,
  complete the ethics training needed for the language comparison study,
  or help figure out how we're going to handle translations of our lessons.
  It's too much to sustain long-term,
  particularly now that I'm doing it pro bono.
  More importantly,
  things that are vital to our long-term health and growth aren't being done,
  and can't be done until there are more staff.
</p>
<p>
  (And no, "get volunteers to do it" isn't a solution.
  Many of these activities are administrative,
  have long lead times,
  and require sustained attention over a period of months;
  our volunteers do a great job of delivering and improving lessons,
  but we need full-time staff to provide continuity.)
</p>
<p>
  We therefore need to raise money,
  both to pay my salary
  and to hire at least one more full-time person to share the load.
  We also need to partner with more institutions
  who can provide staff for coordinating workshops
  in the way that Arliss and Giacomo have been doing.
  While individual donations will help and are very welcome,
  it's vital that we build institutional ties as well.
</p>
<p>
  We can offer several things in return:
  an agreed number of workshops each year,
  on-site instructor training,
  and help with recruiting and publicity for sponsor activities.
  Sponsors will also have a say in our direction:
  the <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/10/announcing-the-creation-of-the-software-carpentry-foundational.html">interim board</a>
  is still working out the details,
  but sponsors will be represented on our board,
  and will be able to shape what we do and how we do it.
  If this sounds like something that you or your organization would be interested in,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.board_inquiries}}">get in touch</a>.

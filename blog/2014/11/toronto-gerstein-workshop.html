<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  Last week we ran a Python-based SWC workshop at the University of
  Toronto's <a href="">Gerstein Science Information Centre</a>. The advertised audience
was graduate students, post-docs and other researchers in science, engineering and medicine at the University of Toronto.
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<p>
The workshop had about 20 learners. Most were grad students or postdocs
in life sciences. The pre-workshop assessment
said that about three-quarters of learners had some programming experience
with about half of those having some Python; maybe half of the total
had some familiarity with the command line.
Almost none had experience with version control or SQL. 
The instructors were P. Barmby, G. Wilson, and T. Guignard, helpers were
S. Rahmani, L. Johnston, D. Neilsen, T. Wright, and X. Fei.
Our host was Erica Lenton.
</p>

<p>
Nearly everyone had done the software installation prior to the workshop (!),
and not too many problems were reported.  The laptops in use
were roughly 50% Mac, 40% Windows, 10% Linux.
A handful of learners ran into the Mac Git problem, on which more below.

<p>
The physical layout of the room was not quite ideal: the projector was pretty 
close to the screen and so the projected area on the screen was quite small.
This meant that we had to use quite large fonts so that people at the back of the
room could see, and only a few lines at a time could be visible in a terminal window. 
The screen was also not centred in the room, which meant
that people in the front row sometimes couldn't see it around the instructor,
and there was a pillar in the room which didn't help visibility either.
The learners were pretty patient with this, but more than for most workshops
they really needed to have material on their own machines to be able to follow along.
Another issue with the room was that the desks were fairly close together: for
cases where a learner would have been best-served by working with a helper rather
than following the lesson, it wasn't really practical for them to move elsewhere,
and conversations with the helper couldn't be kept quiet enough to not disturb
others.

<a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/2014-10-30-utoronto/lessons/">The
  material we covered</a> included: shell (P. Barmby), Git (G. Wilson), Python (P. Barmby and F. Xu), and SQL
(T. Guignard).</p>
<p>
<i>Pauline:</i>Most of the material in the beginner shell lessons was covered the first morning.
I found the pace a bit rushed and I would have liked more time for the students to 
work on their own - I think the lessons contain too much material to really be covered
in 3 hours. Topics I skipped over or felt I didn't explain very well
included "spaces in filenames" and "redirecting input".
I didn't feel that I made very good use of the sticky note
system in the bash session, although I did try something else: I made the
questions at the end of the lessons into multiple-choice questions where they weren't
already, and asked the learners to vote on them with coloured cards (link).
I think this would have been useful except that the available projection screen
real estate was so small that the questions were unreadable!
</p>

<p>
At the morning break, we put a tar file containing the "Nelle" file/directory structure
and a PDF file with the multiple-choice questions on Dropbox, and links to these
in the Etherpad. Learners were able to grab these and found them helpful in following along
for the remainder of the bash session. Feedback from the morning session
included the request to have these files available earlier, and to have an outline
of topics available before the session started, plus requests to go slower!
</p>

The afternoon Git session went very smoothly. Greg took the learners through making
a repository and adding a remote on GitHub, the change/add/commit/push cycle, forking an existing 
repository and adding the upstream remote, submitting pull requests, and 
managing conflicts. As mentioned above, a few students ran into the problem with Git not 
working on their Macs, for which the most obvious (but not-so-practical) fix is to 
download Xcode and recompile <a

<i>Greg:</i> ANYTHING TO ADD HERE?
</p>

<i>Pauline:</i>
The second morning's Python session could have gone more smoothly. I used the
IPython console in Spyder, rather than the IPython notebook for this, in part because
I thought that the notebook would result in me moving too quickly and in part
because I've been having problems with notebooks scrolling very slowly on my machine.
I suggested to students that they should clone the workshop repo in order to
get the CSV and other files we'd be working with, and so that they could follow along
in the notebooks; or they could also just download specific files from
the repo (which, of course, you can't do directly from the GitHub
website; we could have done it with <a href="http://rawgit.com">rawgit.com</a> if I had thought of that!).
Not everyone was able to clone the repo (bandwidth), and in retrospect it would have
been better to put a handful of files in a separate repository or elsewhere,
so that everyone could follow along. We did end up copying one small program directly
to the etherpad so learners could play with it and modify it, but this is obviously
not an ideal solution.
</p>

<p> Because getting going in the morning consumed 
quite a bit of time, the actual lesson started late and felt quite rushed. 
Again, I think it would have been beneficial for learners to spend more time working
on their own -- especially given that we had quite a few helpers so
they could have gotten one-to-one assistance.
I covered numpy, functions, and loops before the morning break, with loops, conditionals,
and command-line scripts afterward, then Xu Fei took over with defensive programming.
<i>Xu</i>: YOUR THOUGHTS HERE.

<p>
Learner feedback emphasized many of the same things as from the bash session: need
to have files in advance, wanted more time to practice, lesson was too
fast. Many learners recognized defensive programming as a concept that
they had not encountered before but would find helpful.

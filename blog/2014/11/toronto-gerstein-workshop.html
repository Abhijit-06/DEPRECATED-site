<p>
  Last week we ran a Python-based SWC workshop at the University of
  Toronto's Gerstein Science Information Centre.  (who were our audience?)
</p>

<p>

The workshop had about 25 (check?) learners. Most were grad students or postdocs
in biomedical sciences (again, check). About three-quarters had some programming experience
with about half of those having some Python; maybe half had seen the command line.
Almost none had experience with version control or SQL. 
The instructors were P. Barmby, G. Wilson, F. Xu, T. Guignard), helpers
  (S. Rahmani, L. Johnston, D. Neilsen). Our hosts were Erica Lenton
and Michael ??.

The physical layout of the room was not quite ideal: the projector was pretty 
close to the screen and so the projected area on the screen was quite small.
This meant that we had to use quite large fonts so that people at the back of the
room could see, and only a few lines at a time could be visible in a terminal window. 
The screen was also not centred in the room, which meant
that people in the front row sometimes couldn't see it around the instructor,
and there was a pillar in the room which didn't help visibility either.
The learners were pretty patient with this, but more than for most workshops
they really needed to have material on their own machines to be able to follow along.
Another issue with the room was that the desks were fairly close together: for
cases where a learner would have been best-served by working with a helper rather
than following the lesson, it wasn't really practical for them to move elsewhere,
and conversations with the helper couldn't be kept quiet enough to not disturb
others.

Nearly everyone had done the software installation prior to the workshop (!),
and not too many problems were reported.  A rough guess is that the laptops in use
were 50-45-5 Mac-Windows-Linux (?) A handful of learners ran into the Mac Git problem,
on which more below.

<h3>Peer Instruction on the Web</h3>
<p>
    This project aims to bring proof-of-concept on-line teaching tool that uses
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_instruction">peer instruction technique</a>.
    More details about the project can be found in Piotr's <a href="http://piotr.banaszkiewicz.org/blog/2014/04/24/peer-instruction-a-summer-project-for-mozilla/">blog post</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The project needs volunteers to test the basic functionality and hopefully
    find bugs. We'll set up an Etherpad and coordinate video calls. The only
    requirement is a new browser, preferably Firefox or Chromium/Chrome, and
    a working webcam.
</p>
<p>
    If you're willing to help with programming,
    <a href="https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz/pitt">Pitt</a> mostly uses
    JavaScript (both front and back-end). There are some
    <a href="https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz/pitt/issues?labels=documentation&state=open">documentation issues open</a>
    that are good to get you started with the project. The project code needs
    reviews by proficient JavaScript programmers, too.
</p>
<p>
    Piotr, the project leader, will be in Krak√≥w, Poland (UTC+2), during the
    sprint. All the required links will appear on
    <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-sprint-2014">sprint's etherpad</a>
    below "A web-based tool for peer instruction" line (currently 102).

<h3>Browsercast: a Web-Based Slideshow Replay Tool</h3>

<h3>Math Virtual Keyboard</h3>
<p>The Math/LaTeX virtual keyboard is going fine and right now Raniere will love if
someone can try it for a few minutes. Raniere will be at Paris site for the sprint
with one of the devices from <a
  href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/FirefoxOS/TCP">Firefox OS Tablet Program</a>
so if you want help me trying it <strong>please</strong> get in touch.</p>
<p>If Software Carpentry manage to kick off the <a
  href="https://github.com/twitwi/lesson-manager/">lesson manager</a> project
Raniere will help with it otherwise he is planning to help reviewing the
improvements to Software Carpentry lessons.</p>

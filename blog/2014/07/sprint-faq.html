  <a href="blog/2014/06/update-on-sprint-plans.html">sprint</a>
  is less than three weeks away,
  so here's a short FAQ to tell you who can take part and how.
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<dl>
  <dt><em>Who can take part?</em></dt>
  <dd>
    Everyone:
    you don't have to have any prior involvement with Software Carpentry, Mozilla, or any particular project.
  </dd>

  <dt><em>Do I need to be a programmer?</em></dt>
  <dd>
    Nope:
    we're also looking for people who can review lessons (particularly from a novice's point of view),
    create illustrations,
    and many other things.
  </dd>

  <dt><em>Do I need to register somewhere?</em></dt>
  <dd>
    No,
    but we'd be grateful if you could add yourself to <a href="{{page.etherpad}}">this Etherpad</a>
    to give us some idea of what project you'd like to work on ("Project Ideas"),
    and where you'd like to work ("Sites").
  </dd>

  <dt><em>Do I have to be at one of the listed sites?</em></dt>
  <dd>
    No,
    but you'll probably get more out of the sprint if you are&mdash;it's always more fun
    to work beside people,
    even if you're not all working on the same project.
  </dd>

  <dt><em>Can I add a new project to the list?</em></dt>
  <dd>
    Sure,
    so long as it's related to open science in some way,
    you (or someone else) is willing to coordinate work on it,
    and there's alreayd something in place for people to extend.
    (Experience has taught us that if a project starts with a blank page, it will probably end with one as well.)
    Please add it to <a href="{{page.etherpad}}">the Etherpad</a>
    and <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">mail us</a> so that we can help advertise it.
  </dd>

  <dt><em>What should I do to prepare?</em></dt>
  <dd>
    <ol>
      <li>Add yourself to <a href="{{page.etherpad}}">the Etherpad</a>.</li>
      <li>Decide which project you'd like to work on.  (We recommend that people focus on just one&mdash;two days goes by very quickly.)</li>
      <li>Have a look at the project's open issues and pull requests to find something to start working on.</li>
    </ol>
  </dd>

  <dt><em>What should I do to prepare my project if I'm coordinating work?</em></dt>
  <dd>
    <ol>
      <li>Make sure it's on <a href="{{page.etherpad}}">the Etherpad</a>.</li>
      <li>Create or tag issues and pull requests for people to start with.</li>
    </ol>
  </dd>

  <dt><em>When should I show up?</em></dt>
  <dd>
    Each site will be open during normal business hours (roughly 9:00 am to 5:00 pm local time).
    We do <em>not</em> want people to work round the clock:
    work done at 3:00 am usually needs to be undone at 10:00 am.
  </dd>

  <dt><em>Do I have to be there on both days?</em></dt>
  <dd>
    No,
    but we do ask that people commit to at least one full day
    (or two half-days)
    so that projects don't spend all of their time getting newcomers on board.
  </dd>

  <dt><em>What about coffee, lunch, and dinner?</em></dt>
  <dd>
    We have asked sites to provide coffee (and snacks if they can),
    but will not provide meals.
    That said,
    we strongly encourage the people working at each site to get lunch together,
    and to go out together at the end of the first day:
    this sprint is meant to help build community,
    and sharing a meal with someone is a great way to get to know them.
  </dd>

  <dt><em>How will sites be connected?</em></dt>
  <dd>
    We will set up a single open-air video conference to connect all of the active sites,
    primarily to give people a sense of who's awake where.
    Individual projects can use <a href="{{site.irc_url}}">IRC</a>,
    HipChat,
    or whatever else they normally use for communication.
  </dd>

  <dt><em>What sites are currently included?</em></dt>
  <dd>
    We will post full addresses and other information a week before the sprint.

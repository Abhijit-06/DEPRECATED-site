  ...this is what Greg Wilson told me after the first-ever <a href="{{site.msl_url}}">Mozilla Science Lab</a> 
  global sprint. Indeed, over the course of two days, dozens of people all over the world
  met virtually and in person to develop and improve Software Carpentry teaching materials,
  infrastructure and a number of MSL-related projects.

<p>
  I was a part of the team in Krakow which focused mainly on the development of training materials for 
  <a href="https://github.com/datacarpentry/">Data Carpenty</a>. 
  Over the course of two days we worked on new material for using the Python and 
  pandas library for data manipulation. We also contributed to expanding lessons for 
  working with data in spreadsheets. Two of us reviewed the lessons on shell. And we also 
  added to the material on using matplotlib. One of the member of Krakow's group, 
  Piotr Banaszkiewicz worked on his own project:
  <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/sciencelab-2014summersprint-peer-instruction"> 
  A Web-Based Tool for Peer Instruction</a>.
</p>

<p>
   The Krakow's team was lead by Klemens Noga (<a href="http://www.cyfronet.krakow.pl/en">Cyfronet </a>AGH) 
   and Leszek Tarkowski (<a href="http://czterybity.pl/">czterybity.pl)</a>. The other seven participants 
   were (in alphabetical order): Piotr Banaszkiewicz (<a href="http://www.agh.edu.pl/en">AGH University of Science and Technology</a>), 
   Maciek Czuchry (<a href="http://www.cyfronet.krakow.pl/en">Cyfronet</a> AGH), Iwona Grelowska 
   (<a href="http://www.agh.edu.pl/en">AGH University of Science and Technology)</a>, Tomasz Jonak 
   (<a href="http://www.agh.edu.pl/en">AGH University of Science and Technology</a>) Sebastian Kupny 
   (<a href="http://www.uj.edu.pl/en/">Jagiellonian University</a>), Aleksandra Pawlik 
   (<a href="http://software.ac.uk">Software Sustainability Institute</a>) and ≈Åukasz Zosiak (ABB Stotz-Kontakt GmbH). 
   On the first day, the sprint was hosted by <a href="http://www.cyfronet.krakow.pl/en">Academic Computing Centre Cyfronet</a>, 
   where we also worked in the morning on the second day. For the last four hours of the sprint we moved to 
   <a href="http://www.ambasadakrakowian.pl/">Ambasada Krakowian</a>, the headquarters of four NGOs, 
   located in the heart of Krakow's Old Town.
</p>

<p>
  On the first day of the sprint Klemens Noga arranged a tour round for all participants to see Cyfronet's 
  <a href="http://www.top500.org/site/47634">supercomputer Zeus</a>. Zeus is noted in the famous Top 500 
  ranking and allows hundreds of researchers to run the code which advances their research.

  The Mozilla Science Lab sprint is over but the work carries on. The event was a real boost and 
  we got a lot of stuff done. Apart from meeting new people, the sprint was also a great opportunity
  to gain more confidence and encouragement to contribute to the current and new projects.

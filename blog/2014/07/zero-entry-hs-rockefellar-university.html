**Introduction**

camille, ivan, timothy, and daniel all had the great opportunity to
teach software carpentry's first zero-entry workshop to high school
students.  We were able to teach at rockafellar thanks to the
scientific and foresight by jeannie and ____ and the rest of the
rockafellar team along with arlis, greg wilson and the swc team.

The main goal of this workshop was to expose tomorrow's scientists to
scientific computing as early as possible.  For example, as genomic
data for biology continues to grow, we are beginning to see a shift of
biologists from the pipeter to the data scientist.  Our goal was not
to teach everyone all the skills needed so they can dive into
retrieving, cleaning, and analysing genomic or astro data the next
day, but rather show them what is possible with computers, and expose
them for the first time that the gui may not always be the best tool
for the job; and give some foundation of knowledge and concepts for
pepetual self learning.

We followed the traditional swc workshop materials, adapting the pace
as needed.  Bash, python, and git were covered.

**What Went Well, and What Didn't**

Bash

We began in bash with the basic pwd, cd, and ls commands.  Eventually
moving to mkdir and touch.  The helpers realized very quickly that the
students were struggling to keep up.  2 common themes were coming up:
'did i do this right? it doesnt look like what's up there'.  'i don't
understand what is going on'.  For those who live in bash, or use the
terminal regularly, we customize the look of the prompt, removing
extraneous information, changing the '$', etc.  From the student's
point of view, they've never seen a blinking cursor in its current
context.  Trying to follow along while blindly typing what the see on
the screen, except what they see on the presentation screen was not
what they saw on their own monitor. and thus confusion arised, even
though many of them created and moved into the correct directory.  The
students were very literal, as they shold be when exposed to a new
concept.  However, as literal as they were, spelling mistakes were
common, and learning to tab complete was a lesson they were learning
the hard way.

**Introduction**

camille, ivan, timothy, and Daniel all had the great opportunity to
teach software carpentry's first zero-entry workshop to high school
students.  We were able to teach at Rockefeller thanks to the
scientific and foresight by Jeannie and ____ and the rest of the
Rockefeller team along with arlis, Greg Wilson and the swc team.

The main goal of this workshop was to expose tomorrow's scientists to
scientific computing as early as possible.  For example, as genomics
data for biology continues to grow, we are beginning to see a shift of
biologists from the pipetter to the data scientist.  Our goal was not
to teach everyone all the skills needed so they can dive into
retrieving, cleaning, and analyzing genomics or astronomy data the next
day, but rather show them what is possible with computers, and expose
them for the first time that the GUI may not always be the best tool
for the job; and give some foundation of knowledge and concepts for
perpetual self learning.

We followed the traditional swc workshop materials, adapting the pace
as needed.  Bash, python, and git were covered.

**What Went Well, and What Didn't**

High School Students

Since there is a lot of material that we cover in 2 days, the lessons
are given in 90 minute blocks.  For the typical NYC high school (I'm
now speaking from personal experience), there are 10 blocks of 45
minues each through out each day.  Some classes may take a 2 period
block (90 minutes), but almost never is the entire day solely taught
in 90 minute blocks.  In higher education a 90 minute class is almost
considered the baseline and is very common with many other classes
lasting much longer.  This difference was echoed to us when we
finished our workshop and had a 15 minute open discussion of what
worked for the students, and what did not.  Many suggested to have 4
half-day workshops, each covering 1 topic with some `homework'.
Reflecting on this point, this makes sense and should be tested the
next time we teach high school students.

Bash

We began in bash with the basic pwd, cd, and ls commands.  Eventually
moving to mkdir and touch.  The helpers realized very quickly that the
students were struggling to keep up.  Common questions were:

    - Did I do this right?
        - It doesn't look like what's up there
    - I don't understand what is going on

For those of us who live in bash, or use the terminal regularly, we
customize the look of the prompt, removing extraneous information,
adding colors, and etc.  From the student's point of view, they've
never seen a blinking cursor in its current context.  Trying to follow
along while blindly typing what the see on the screen, except what
they see on the presentation screen was not what they saw on their own
monitor; thus confusion arose, even though many of them created and
moved into the correct directory.  A possible workaround is to have
all students copy paste an ls alias that colors directories (this is
not a default in OSX), and everyone (instructors included) export the
same PS1.  The former can be done right after the ls command is
brought up, and searching through the man pages for the --color flag.
Experimentation with when the optimal time to export the PS1 variable
would have to be conducted, but it seems that a black box 'please copy
paste this so your terminal looks like mine' may be sufficient.

The students were very literal, as they should be when exposed to a new
concept.  However, as literal as they were, spelling mistakes were
common, and learning to tab complete was a lesson they were learning
the hard way.

When using bash to navigate and create files, zero-entry bootcampers
do not have a mental image of the directory structure/hierarchy.  A
GUI file system window that is shown simultaneously with the basic
navigation and touch/mkdir commands solidify and contextualize what
exactly is going on in the file system them that mkdir and touch
ACTUALLY create files in the GUI interface as well.  This can be
accomplished by running the following terminal commands for Windows,
OSX, and linux operating systems, respectively:

    - explorere .
    - open .
    - xdg-open . (or 'nautilus .' in Ubuntu)



Conceptual notes

From the perspective of zero-entry bootcampers, almost everything is a
buzzword.  Pro-tip: Definitions for words like “float”, “escaping a
character”, long-hand mnemonics for commands (i.e. pwd = “Print
Working Directory”, cd = “change directory”) or differences between
using () {} ‘’ and “ “ in bash, python, etc. need to be re-iterated.
Some kind of physical cheat-sheet with basic commands for bash, git,
ipynb, and python would be usefu`l. Also bash wildcards syntax Also
Ctrl-C to break in Bash, Ctrl-D to exit Py interpreter, Q to exit a
manpage For high school kids, attention spans are short (so
surprisingly short).  Pro-tip: Short concept, short exercise, rinse,
and repeat.  For kids that have a little more experience, they’ll get
bored.  Pro-tip: Send them to a site with short challenge exercises so
they don’t get bored (i.e. rosalind.info/problems/list-view/ or
projecteuler.net for python;
http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/ for git.  I found that
kids had trouble understanding the value of toy exercises. When I was
helping with during the Python session, some seemed to be very worried
about having the example or exercise “right”, as the value of the task
was just this. I think that exercises/examples should be tuned to
connect to their previous experiences or otherwise have some sense of
completion (e.g. ipythonblocks).  we gave them a mini project that was
a cumulation of all the python material by asking them to read in a
file of comma separated animals, their bain mass, and body mass, asked
them to parse the information and calculate the bain:body ratio and
have it saved to a list (or dictionary) Even though Tim did a great
job essentially doing the problem for them before assigning the
problem, when it was their turn, many of the students were simply
‘stumped’ and overwhelmed and had ‘no idea where to start’ This became
a very powerful example of breaking down the problem (engineering),
and the use of comments.  Showing them comments and how they can be
used to pesudo-write code and get some process out without be burdened
by actual code 1. forces them to actually break down a problem into
manageable practices and makes the problem less daunting.  2. show a
real practical use case of comments and how they can be used before
any code is written, not just documenting what you already have done.
I think we did a great job introducing good practices in programming.
Hopefully the next time they are asked to implement their knowledge it
becomes less daunting

Logistical notes
They really need coffee in the afternoon. 
Seating makes a difference in keeping the kids engaged and off of facebook/browsing/world cup watching - the closer they are to the front of the room, the more engaged they’ll likely be
They need more frequent sticky note check-ins, i.e. “Green sticky up if you’re keeping up/done with the exercise/etc.”
They are more used to raising a hand than red sticky up.  But having multiple means of calling for help caters to different people
The etherpad is especially useful for the younger crowd at the beginning of the bootcamp - many of them are too shy to ask questions, and the chatroom-like environment works for them
when you want them to copy paste commands from the command line… maybe don’t put in the “$ command”.  they just copy the entire line (with your $) and do not see the mistake
suggest swc instructors all export a temporary PS1 variable so all the terminals look the same.  The students were REALLY confused in the beginning of bash because what they saw on the screen was not what they saw on the projector.  (at least to whoever is doing bash)
having a directory of 48,000 files of mixed file types and having them mv a certain pattern of files (e.g. i want my 2013 pictures that are some form of .jpg into a pics/2013 subfolder) really gave them a real world context on why the GUI is bad.  having the gui file manager window crash or take 5 minutes to draw all the icons helped bring it all home.  Not to mention, we finished the entire exercise before the gui loaded all the icons.  If only there was that powerful of an example for git…
maybe one of the instructors can “accidentally” blow up their presentation materials at the beginning of their talk, and then rescue them from their repo?
Whiteboard / Blackboard is useful

Technical notes
man pages don’t work in git bash.  Pro-tip:  Have them look at the man page online if you want to walk them through reading a man page.
ipython notebook can lose connectivity if the wireless goes on and off (we think this was the reason).  Pro-tip:  Kernel->Interrupt, Kernel->Restart, Cell->Run All
For windows users, they can’t use many of the Bash commands in the ipython notebook Pro-tip: preface the cell with %%bash
Git for snow leopard: need to get v 1.8 not the version the website.  This should get around the 4GB xcode download.  If that doesn’t work, download “Git for Mac Users” https://mac.github.com/ .  open the application.  to go properties, there is a option in one of the tabs to “enable command line tools” (maybe do this first? in the future?)
Installation: include some final steps that let students verify that the installations were successful, e.g. `which python`, `which git` 
Which git doesn't work on some people (like the snow.  Got init will diagnose a people better.

  Short version: we will launch a second pilot study of code review
  for scientific software in February 2014, in which experienced
  mentors will teach small groups of scientists how and when to do
  reviews.  We are currently looking for both mentors and groups to
  take part.

  Long version: in August-September 2013, the Mozilla Science Lab,
  PLOS, and Prof. Marian Petre (Open University, UK) conducted a
  <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2013/11/code-review-report.html">pilot study</a>
  of code review of scientific software.  Professional
  software developers form Mozilla reviewed parts of the software
  associated with papers published during the preceding year in "PLoS
  Computational Biology", and those reviews were then shared with the
  authors of the papers.
</p>
<p>
  This study's principal findings were that:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    both developers and scientists were enthusiastic about the
    possibility of collaborating in this way, but
  </li>
  <li>
    a "drive-by" review at the end of the research process by someone
    who didn't understand the science being investigated wasn't
    actually much help.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  We now believe that scientists would benefit more from ongoing reviews
  as they develop their code, and that the reviewer must be familiar
  with the science itself in order to do a "deep" review.  We therefore
  plan to conduct a second pilot study to validate these beliefs.
</p>
<p>
  In it, we will match an experienced scientist-programmer (the mentor)
  with a small pre-existing team of scientists who are developing and
  sharing software, but who do not think of themselves primarily as
  software developers, and who are not yet doing code reviews.  The
  mentor will do a small number of code reviews early in the study to
  show the team what reviews look like, when they should be done, how
  results should be communicated, etc.  After that, mentors will be
  responsible for coaching the scientists over a 12-week period as they
  do reviews themselves.
</p>
<p>
  We will observe mentors and teams throughout the study period to
  determine:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    what skills are actually transferred,
  </li>
  <li>
    how those skills are adapted to meet scientists' domain-specific needs,
  </li>
  <li>
    what transference techniques are most effective, and
  </li>
  <li>
    what other shifts in working practice result (e.g., more
    collaborative or iterative work).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All findings will be published under open access licenses to encourage
  further discussion and uptake.
</p>
<p>
  We will start this study in February 2014.  We are currently looking
  for a few more mentors, and more importantly, for small groups of
  scientists who would like to give code review a try.  If you are
  interested, please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">mail us</a> a
  short paragraph describing your research, and a link to your version
  control repository if you have one.

<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
Last week Software Carpentry paired up with MATLAB to run a bootcamp 
at the University of Manchester. Apart from shell and version control, 
the remaining core topics (verification and testing, modular programming 
with algorithm design) were taught using MATLAB.

<p>
The bootcamp was offered to the University of Manchester staff and 
postgraduate students. We started on 14th January teaching 24 
participants shell and then version control with Git. The day finished 
with the introduction to the MATLAB language and desktop environment. 
The next day covered algorithm design, test and verification and debugging 
and improving performance. All these modules were taught using MATLAB. 
</p>

<p>
The main organiser was <a href="http://software.ac.uk/fellows/mike-croucher">
Mike Croucher</a>, a Software Sustainability Institute's Fellow. MATLAB 
material was taught by Jos Martin, Ken Deeley and Juan Martinez 
from Mathworks. The other two instructors were Shoaib Sufi and myself. 
</p>

<p>
It was the first time that MATLAB was used for teaching at Software Carpentry. 
For a number of participants the fact that we used MATLAB was an additional 
encouragement to attend the bootcamp.

<p>
In the feedback questionnaire the participant said what they thought 
they learnt that would be useful:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  Using Git and also some new functions for MATLAB 
  </p>
  <p>
  How to use cell arrays and tables in MATLAB, as well as a few 
  usefull functions. Very useful were the tips on coding practices 
  and testing environments in MATLAB
  </p>
  <p>
  Tricks in MATLAB, such as the section feature.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Even for more experienced attendees the bootcamp turned out to be useful:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This is a little difficult to answer because this course actually helped
 me realise how much I already knew! But I did learn a couple of things
 (the difference between explicit/implicit memory allocation when a
 variable is initialised, and testing algorithms with various testcases). 
I am certain these will come in handy as I write algorithms 70% of the time!

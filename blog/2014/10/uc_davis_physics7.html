<p>
Have you ever learned something new and then had it appear in other areas of your life?
After a summer at SWC thinking about how to train better instructors (and how to be a better
teacher myself) I get to try discussion-based teaching this quarter at UC Davis.
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->

This summer at SWC we've spent a lot of time discussing "Building A Better Teacher" by
Elizabeth Green (<a href = "{{page.root}}/blog/2014/09/building-better-teachers.html">
here is Greg's blog post on the book</a>).
This book focuses on training teachers to lead students on a
journey of discovery rather than teaching them a series of rules. The assumption is that
teachers tend to tell their students a series of rules rather than leading students
through a series of questions and class discussions which will ultimately allow students
to figure out the rules as a class.
</p>
<p>
I just started in the Physics graduate program at UC Davis. Unbeknownst to me, the Physics
department has an education research group which has been thinking about how to teach
physics with the same philosophy as Elizabeth Green discusses
(here is a link to their paper describing their methodology and results:
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.6970v2.pdf">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.6970v2.pdf</a>,
summarized in the next paragraph).
I (and my fellow first years) are lucky enough to teach this course and have spent the
last 3 days training to be an instructor.
</p>
<p>
The Physics 7 consists of 1 hour a week of lecture and 5 hours of discussion lab. The discussion labs
meet twice a week for 2.5 hours and are a series of activities that allow the students to
use, think through, and extend the equations and concepts that they've learned in class to
better understand them. While there are quizes in lecture, the discussion labs grades are
based on participation. In class most activities are discussed in small groups. Each
group has a blackboard on which they write up their answers and then the whole class discusses
the conclusions of each group. I'm really excited to try this method of teaching and would
like to see if we can extend it to SWC.
</p>
<p>
I haven't actually instructed yet (classes start Thursday) so I'm not ready to reform our
instruction (yet) but I can discuss the training.
There are 3 pieces that I think we could easily implement in SWC instructor training. In
the following paragraphs I will refer to the people teaching the instructor training course as
'teachers' and the people being trained as 'instructors'.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Classes were video taped and clips of the videos were shown and discussed
with the class. Occasionally the video was paused so the teacher could point out a particular
teaching method or issue we might encounter. I could see this being used from anything
to viewing what it looks like to give the class an exercise, to going over the solution,
to walking around the room, to answering a question, to using the etherpad, to switching
between the shell and something else. Nothing compares to seeing a method in action.
</li>
<li>The teachers lead an exercise with the instructors as the class. This allowed us to
both get a sense of how the class flowed and to see how
teachers handled different situations (such as calling on students, differing
explanations from different groups, leading a group discussion, walking around the room,
etc). We were also given plenty of time to ask questions so the teacher could further
explain why he was doing what he was doing.
</li>
<li>
Finally, we split a lesson into small pieces which encapsulated both small group
discussion and whole class discussion. Each instructor taught a section to the rest of the
class. After each section the instructor was asked how he/she thought it went and then
the class and teacher gave both positive and negative feedback. Most interesting tidbit I
picked up today: move around the class so that you are always on the opposite side of the
room from who ever is speaking, they will naturally speak to you and include the whole
class.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I can't wait to start teaching this section and see all this pedagogy in action.

  Being a former particle physicist myself, I used to talk to many people about my job. Most of the time, it was very hard for them to imagine how our daily work looked like. They were often imagining us as white coated geniuses wondering corridors and labs to discuss worm holes and time travel or alike. Many people had heard of the large machinery (e.g. the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Switzerland) that is required to perform modern particle physics at a meaningful level. but besides the effort of building and running such a machine, many had no idea how the operation of this accelerator could be benefited from.<br>

  Often I told them about the experiments that are used to record particle collisions. I explained how complex these multi-purpose detectors are setup and what effort is involved to store, transfer and analyse the data produced by them. At some point, I often made the statement that my day job is nothing more than a software developer in a scientific context. Then, some poeple wondered: "But did you actually learn how to program?" The answer an average PhD student in particle physics will give in this very moment is "No."<br>
  Two years into my thesis, a federal German funding agency initiated a german network for particle physics, the Helmholtz Alliance Physics at the Terascale, to induce higher scientific throughput just in time with the LHC coming online in 2009. Thus funding program also contained budgets for training of staff related to it. Motivated by a neverending and daily struggle to work with object-oriented frameworks that were poorly documented and yet state-of-art and of high complexity, I started to inquire about the possibility to organise a workshop on software design principles. It was my hope that through transferring knowledge from the computer science domain to the physics students at the keyboard, one could help to pull ourselves out of the swamp. <br>

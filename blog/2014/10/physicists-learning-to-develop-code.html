<p>
  Being a former particle physicist myself, I used to talk to many people about my job. Most of the time, it was very hard for them to imagine how our daily work looked like. They were often imagining us as white coated geniuses wondering corridors and labs to discuss worm holes and time travel or alike. Many people had heard of the large machinery (e.g. the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Switzerland) that is required to perform modern particle physics at a meaningful level. but besides the effort of building and running such a machine, many had no idea how the operation of this accelerator could be benefited from.<br>
  So often I told them about the experiments that are used to record particle collisions. I explained how complex these multi-purpose detectors are setup and what effort is involved to store, transfer and analyse the data produced by them. At some point, I often made the statement that my day job is nothing more than a software developer in a scientific context. Then, some poeple wondered: "But did you actually learn how to program?"<br>

<p>
  As we <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/10/announcing-the-creation-of-the-software-carpentry-foundational.html">announced</a>
  two weeks ago,
  we are setting up an independent foundation to manage Software Carpentry's continued growth.
  This week, we passed an important milestone
  when we signed a fiscal sponsorship agreement with <a href="http://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>.
  There are still lots of details to sort out,
  but here are brief answers to some of the questions we've received so far:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Congratulations!</dt>
  <dd>
    That's not a question, but thank you :-)
  </dd>
  <dt>What is NumFOCUS?</dt>
  <dd>
    NumFOCUS is registered as a 501(c) charity in the United States
    which promotes and supports the ongoing research and development of open-source computing tools
    through educational, community, and public channels.
  </dd>
  <dt>What is the Software Carpentry Foundation's relationship with NumFOCUS?</dt>
  <dd>
    Partnering with NumFOCUS saves us the overhead of incorporating separately:
    they will accept donations and make payments on our behalf,
    handle reporting for tax purposes,
    and so on,
    so that we can concentrate on developing curriculum and delivering training.
  </dd>
  <dt>Is Software Carpentry still part of Mozilla?</dt>
  <dd>
    No,
    but the <a href="http://mozillascience.org/">Mozilla Science Lab</a> is one of our partners,
    along with the <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/">Software Sustainability Institute</a>
    and <a href="http://lbl.gov">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>.
    All three are represented on our board,
    and we hope other organizations will partner with us soon as well&mdash;please
    stay tuned for announcements.
  </dd>
  <dt>Who works for the Software Carpentry Foundation?</dt>
  <dd>
    Greg Wilson has left Mozilla to work full-time for the SCF;
    Arliss Collins and Giacomo Peru are continuing to organize workshops as they always have
    as part of their jobs for the Mozilla Science Lab and the Software Sustainability Institute respectively.
  </dd>
  <dt>Who's paying for all of this?</dt>
  <dd>
    We have several grant applications in the works,
    but are still trying to figure out whether and how to supplement those
    with per-workshop donations, registration fees, or other income
    to become self-sustaining.
  </dd>
  <dt>Can my organization help, and if so, how?</dt>
  <dd>
    We're still working out the details of various possible partnership arrangements,
    but yes,
    we are very interested in talking to potential partners who can help us organize and deliver training,
    and to sponsors who can help us financially.
  </dd>
  <dt>What happens next?</dt>
  <dd>
    The interim board will finish drafting the SCF's initial bylaws
    and arrange the transition to the first permanent board
    early in 2015.
  </dd>
  <dt>Can I make a personal donation to the cause?</dt>
  <dd>
    Soon!
  </dd>
  <dt>How else can I help?</dt>
  <dd>
    The same ways you always have:
    host a workshop,
    become an instructor,
    contribute to our teaching materials,
    and help the scientists you work with adopt better computing practices.
  </dd>
  <dt>Where can I find out more?</dt>
  <dd>
    Please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">mail us</a> or add a comment on this post
    and we'll get back to you as quickly as we can.

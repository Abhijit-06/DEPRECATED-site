<!-- start excerpt -->
In Septemper, Greg Wilson wrote a <a href='http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/09/building-better-teachers.html'>
blog post</a> on "Building better teachers" that was inspired by an <a href='https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/issues/689'>issue</a>
brought up by John Blischak on reporting time spent on lessons.  In order for us
capture this information, we had to revamp the post workshop instructor surveys.
<!-- end excerpt -->

We began by first asking all the instructors who participated in teaching this past
summer to report time spent on teach 'language' (Shell, Python, Git, etc) and
any thing that worked or did not work during the workshop.  A <a href='https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/pull/789'>pull request</a>
provided the first pieces of data for instructors with regards to time spend
on each topic.

Other than Git, the times were fairly consistent with one another.  I say other
than git, because Damien manages to each Git in 1 hour, by not having students
type along, rather he has them watch him go through the git commands.  He has
provided us with a <a href='http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/10/workshop-recording.html'> recording </a>
of a workshop for us to listen to.

The individual questions for the survey is at the end of this post.  However, there
are a few questions for the other instructors to keep in mind while reviewing the
survey.
<ul>
	<li> What order should the questions be presented in?  In groups by topic, or
		topics by group.  That is should we ask all the questions pertaining to Shell,
		then all the questions relating to Python, etc... or should we have a section for

In Septemper, Greg Wilson wrote a
<a href='http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/09/building-better-teachers.html'>
blog post</a> on "Building better teachers" that was inspired by an 
<a href='https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/issues/689'> issue</a>
brought up by John Blischak on reporting time spent on lessons.  In order for us
capture this information, we had to revamp the post workshop instructor surveys.
<!-- end excerpt -->
<h2>First round of data collection</h2>
We began by asking all the instructors who participated in teaching this past
summer to report time spent on teach 'language' (Shell, Python, Git, etc) and
any thing that worked or did not work during the workshop.  A 
<a href='https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/pull/789'>pull request</a>
provided the first pieces of data for instructors with regards to time spend
on each topic.

<ul>
	<li> Git
	<ul>
		<li> n = 8
		<li> min = 1 hour
		<li> median = 2.25 hours
		<li> mean = 2.06 hours
		<li> max = 3.5 hours
	</ul>
	<li> Python
	<ul>
		<li> n = 5
		<li> min = 4 hours
		<li> median = 4.5 hours
		<li> mean = 4.9 hours
		<li> max = 6 hours
	</ul>
	<li> Shell
	<ul>
		<li> n = 8
		<li> min = 1.5 hours
		<li> median = 3 hours
		<li> mean = 2.8 hours
		<li> max = 3.5 hours
	</ul>
	<li> SQL
	<ul>
		<li>n = 1
		<li> min = 3 hours
		<li> median = 3 hours
		<li> mean = 3 hours
		<li> max = 3 hours
	</ul>
</ul>

Other than Git, the times were fairly consistent with one another.  I say "other
than git", because Damien manages to each Git in 1 hour by not having students
type along.  Rather he has them watch him go through the git commands.  There is
a
<a href='http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/10/workshop-recording.html'> recording </a>
of a workshop he ran for us to listen to.  Additionally, we only had 1 workshop
that responded that covered all 4 topics.  SQL is usually left out in place of
Python.

<h2>Revamped survey</h2>

The individual questions for the survey is at the end of this post.  However, 
there are a few questions for the other instructors to keep in mind while 
reviewing the survey.
<ul>
	<li> <b>What order should the questions be presented in?</b>  In questions by lesson, or
		lessons by questions.  That is, 
		should we ask all the questions pertaining to Shell,
		then all the questions relating to Python, etc... (questions by lesson) 
		or 
		should we have a section for time, deviation from the repo material, etc
		and have all the topics under each section (lessons by question)
	<li> <b>Is there any other information you think would be useful to track?</b>
	I have added swc installer and ipython notebook use/installation/problems
	<li> <b>Would <i>you</i> take this survey?</b>  Is it too long? the question
	format is bad, etc.  Any feedback on the survey design and layout is greatly
	appreciated.
	<li> <b>Are the reference examples for the likert scale questions well spaced?</b>
	The reason for the reference example is to provide some context for instructors
	so we can have some standardized set of responses.
	<li> <b>How feasible is it to track individual topics in a lesson?</b>
	John mentioned that time spent on an entire lesson (i.e., total time for python)
	is not that useful when instructors are trying to pace the lesson.  For example, if
	there is only 30 minutes left for Python, is there enough time to teach the v5 testing
	material?
</ul>

<h2>First draft of revamped survey</h2>
The live survey can be found here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rMuWJ8FrnvOWwHfI8aDVHUxDw0ZvOfCges2k3OliZq8/viewform?usp=send_form

The static post of the survey is replicated below:

		<li> What fraction of the attendees were novices (doing copy-and-paste coding without really understanding it)
		<li> What fraction of the attendees were intermediate (already using the shell and writing multi-page programs)
		<li> These questions are on a 5 point scale via radio buttons: None, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, All

<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  You probably haven't seen the 1998 movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120738/"><em>Lost in Space</em></a>,
  or if you have,
  you've suppressed the memory&mdash;it was awful.
  But I do know one guy who enjoyed it.
  His name was Joe,
  and he had worked on the software used to create its special effects.
  Ten minutes into the film he took out his iPod,
  put on his headphones,
  and spent the next two hours head-bobbing to a mix of Bob Marley and Smashing Pumpkins.

  Joe enjoyed the movie because he was looking for something different in it than the rest of us.
  Luckily for him,
  the story and dialog were irrelevant;
  what he cared about was edge glitches in spheroid lighting effects,
  which made the after-movie discussion with the rest of us rather surreal.

  Something similar happens pretty regularly on
  <a href="{{site.mailing_lists}}/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/">our 'discuss' list</a>.
  This week,
  for example,
  <a href="{{site.mailing_lists}}/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2014-October/002259.html">Ben Marwick's message</a>
  about Docker containers
  generated a thread with a couple of dozen replies (and counting).
  Some of the discussion is about the mechanics of deploying Docker,
  resizing windows,
  and so on;
  other parts are about what happens in the classroom when you do this
  and what novices find easy or hard.
</p>
<p>
  It feels in places like two conversations have been interleaved&mdash;like
  some people are looking at the effects
  and others are thinking about character development.
  Given our mission,
  I don't think either can exist without the other;
  the trick is to make sure people from both camps feel like they can participate and are welcome to do so.
</p>
<p>
  What makes that complicated is the disparity between what people feel they need to know in order to take part in a discussion of Docker containers,
  and what they feel they need to know in order to have opinions on pedagogy.
  Specialized, hard-won knowledge exists in both areas;
  the difference is that while you have to have that in order to say something about the details of particular technologies,
  you don't in order to venture an opinion on teaching.
  It's what my friend Bob calls "cab driver economics":
  for a whole bunch of social reasons,
  people feel that everyone is entitled to have an opinion about some topics,
  while others are viewed as open only to the specialized few.
</p>
<p>
  Part of what we try to do in <a href="{{site.training_url}}">the instructor training course</a>
  is make people aware that educational research is just as intellectually rigorous as computing,
  and that while getting reliable answers may be difficult,
  it's possible,
  and striving to do so is rewarding even when it fails.
  Some day,
  if all goes well,
  we might well realize that Software Carpentry's greatest long-term impact was not improving computing skills,
  but getting technophiles to talk about teaching at the same rarefied level as they discuss virtualization.

<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  I've written and spoken several times in the last year
  about an absence that puzzles me:
  while massive open contribution is now normal for both software
  (think Linux and Python)
  and knowledge
  (Wikipedia),
  it's rare for teaching materials.
  Lots of sites allow people to deposit slides, lesson plans, exercises, and the like,
  but collaborating on their creation is still very rare:
  by and large,
  they don't fork, modify, and merge to improve things.
</p>
<p>
  Most of the reasons are undoubtedly social,
  but there are technical obstacles as well.
  In particular,
  there isn't anything equivalent to dependency checking:
  if I build my lesson B on top of your lesson A,
  and you then change lesson A,
  I have to re-read both to make sure that B still makes sense.
</p>
<p>
  It shouldn't be too hard to build a tool to do this
  based on the terms that various lessons use and define.
  Here's how I imagine it working:
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<ol>
  <li>
    A lesson's "inputs" are the terms it uses without defining;
    its "outputs" are the terms it defines.
  </li>
  <li>
    Definitions are explicitly marked
    (e.g., written as <code>&lt;term&gt;something&lt;/term&gt;</code>
    or <code>&lt;a href="glossary.html#something"&gt;something&lt;/a&gt;</code>).
    Uses are not,
    because it would be a lot more work for authors to maintain.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>rob lesson_file_1 lesson_file_2 ...</code>
    checks that the specified lessons are consistent
    by extracting all the terms defined in all the lessons
    and checking that no term is used before it is defined.
    This requires multiple extractors and detectors to handle various file types,
    but that's straightforward to do.
    (I've called the tool <code>rob</code> after one of my favorite teachers,
    and because there's no other widely-used open source tool with that name.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>rob -d external_lesson_dir lesson_file_1 lesson_file_2 ...</code>
    looks in the directory <code>external_lesson_dir</code>
    for a manifest similar to those used by package managers
    to find definitions in external "imported" lessons.
    This allows someone to build a lesson on top of something like Software Carpentry
    in the same way that they can build their own libraries on top of NumPy or SciPy.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  <code>rob</code> is very simple-minded,
  but I think that's a good thing:
  things like SCORM have failed to catch on with non-specialists
  because they require a large investment up front.
  And a lot of details would have to be worked out before <code>rob</code> would be useful,
  like synonym handling and circular references among glossary entries,
  but even simple use-def checking would make life easier.

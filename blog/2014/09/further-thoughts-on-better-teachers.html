  I just finished
  reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Building-Better-Teacher-Teaching-Everyone/dp/0393081591/"><em>Building
  a Better Teacher</em></a> - it was interesting, and a well-written
  story. It turns out I completely agree
  with <a href="building-better-teachers.html">Greg's assessment</a>,
  but very much disagree with his proposed solutions!

<p>
  On the idea of talking through bootcamps every other week, this is
  going to hit the fundamental problem that most of us not only teach
  only once or twice a year "on the side", but we only think about
  teaching once or twice a year. I don't think many people (speaking
  for myself as well) are going to make the time to show up for one of
  these calls if we're not immediately about to teach a bootcamp, when
  we're in teaching mode. On the taping idea, 5-10 minutes isn't
  nearly long enough to learn anything useful about the flow of a
  lesson - especially since, as the book points out, the important
  skill of teaching is usually how to respond to uncertainty and
  perceive misunderstandings in individual students' behavior. I doubt
  we'll get enough of that in such a short slice of time.
</p>
<p>
  More generally, in both cases, I think these miss the second biggest
  point of the book (after "good teachers can be made, but it requires
  coaching and practice"), which is that direct, "thick",
  interpersonal interactions are the way that coaching works. Big
  group events like this are too impersonal, in my opinion, to deal
  with the human side of learning to teach.
</p>
<p>
  But I don't think all is lost. Here are two concrete
  counter-proposals that I think would work better (also inspired, of
  course, by the book). Both are essentially built around individual
  bootcamp experiences, when we have instructors' attention. Some of
  the other comments so far on the blog post have hinted at similar
  ideas.
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Mentorship. This has been floated before in various forms, but I
      think that it's a great idea to have a handful of the
      instructors (senior instructors?) volunteer, or be nominated, or
      apply, to be a class of mentors. Every new instructor should be
      strongly encouraged (in a perfect world, required, but that's
      probably not feasible) to teach one of his/her first two
      bootcamps under the guidance of a mentor. The mentor will help
      with lesson planning, observe the lesson, help with real-time
      adjustments (i.e., whisper in the instructor's ear) if things
      are going pear shaped, and provide feedback after the fact. This
      gives the new instructor the additional benefit of watching an
      experienced instructor frame an entire two day workshop.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sticking point would be how to select mentors and get them the
      additional training needed to be effective mentors. That would
      take some logistical work, but I think it's increasingly
      worthwhile to have this second "tier" of instructors as our
      group continues to grow. Think of those academic family trees -
      Greg is the "root PI", who trained a set of new PhD's at the
      beginning, some of whom (who wanted to put in the time and
      effort) started their own labs.  New instructors who really
      wanted to dive in deep could be encouraged to travel around to
      teach with a selection of several mentors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Single bootcamp <em>jugyokenkyu</em>. Sort of a light version of
      the above. At every bootcamp, the other instructors and helpers
      who are present should be tasked with observing (at least out of
      the corner of their eye) how an instructor teaches each
      lesson. Every instructor/helper should fill out a short, half
      page form at the end of a lesson telling the instructor four
      things - what went well from a teaching perspective and what
      could be improved, and what went well from a content perspective
      and what could be improved (always in a friendly way). These are
      given to the instructors for review.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, at the conclusion of the bootcamp, the instructors sit
      together for 15-30 minutes to debrief on how the bootcamp went,
      discussing what's on the forms as well as bigger picture
      items. The lead instructor then reports back a summary of this
      discussion - a form could be useful, but I think two paragraphs
      of prose written to SWC central could be better. Note that this
      places a bit more burden on the lead instructor while removing
      it from the other instructors, which I think is more workable in
      practice.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  In both cases, what these really do is address what is at heart a
  question of scalability - how to create a less centralized and more
  networked architecture for SWC that is organized around smaller hubs
  and sub-groups of instructors, rather than have everything organized
  around a back and forth to and from the mothership. Note that both
  of your suggestions are based on the mothership-coordination model.
</p>
<p>
  Of course these are just suggestions, and details could surely be
  improved with further discussion. Speaking of which, will you be
  organizing a group of us to try to take on some of these challenges?
  Seems that we have a reasonable subset of instructors who are
  specifically interested and experienced in the act of teaching
  itself.

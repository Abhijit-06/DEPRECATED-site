## Intro

* United Airlines did it to me again, so I had time to think about where we are and where I'd like us to be
* Instructor training is getting better, and two more trainers are spinning up
* Time to worry about the lessons again

## Problems

* bc repo is too big
  * lessons and workshop sites don't have to be tied together because very few people change the latter when doing the former
* scope creep: we have lessons that most workshops will never get to
  * part of why the bc repo has become bloated
* some lessons don't work well
  * micro (e.g., the temperature conversion examples in the Python lesson)
  * macro (e.g., introducing NumPy and visualization early in the Python lesson)
  * goal (computational competence) is getting lost
    * we're teaching Python and R as languages instead of using them as vehicles to teach good programming practice

## Proposal

* break up the bc repository
  * we don't put code for different libraries in one big repo - why would we do the equivalent for lessons?
* result is:
  * one repo that's a template for workshop websites
  * one repo for each lesson (e.g., 'novice/bash' becomes its own repo)
* but if we do this, there's no reason to have just one lesson for any combination of subject and level
  * allows specialization by topic: novice-python-economists, accelerated-R-biologists, etc.
  * allows differentiation by teaching approach: Jane's "Git for novices" may be quite different from Ahmed's
  * makes it a lot easier for people to add specialized lessons (which they maintain)
* Software Carpentry certifies lessons in the same way that it certifies instructors
  * and certifies workshops based on the lessons they're including

## Mechanics

* specify a template for structuring a lesson
  * just as R and Django specify where things go for a package or application
* extract novice Software Carpentry lessons from the bc repo as a starting point
  * _without_ losing history
* extract workshop website stuff into another repo

## Challenges

* what to do with outstanding pull requests against bc?
  * "merge 'em all before splitting" is probably impractical, so...?
* findability: how to locate lesson repos once we have lots?
  * start with a links page on software-carpentry.org (because we'll only have half a dozen things to track)
  * worry about handling growth if growth occurs
* trackability: how can people keep up with changes to lessons?
  * right now, only have to subscribe to the bc repo - subscribing to half a dozen is more annoying
  * try it and see
  * (in practice, most instructors _aren't_ paying attention to bc: the 90/9/1 rule)
* how to handle resources shared by all (or most) lesson repos?
  * dynamic resources (like CSS files) are easy: load 'em from software-carpentry.org
  * compile-time resources (like _include and _layouts files) can be duplicated for now
    * submodules didn't work well the last time we tried them
    * if all lesson repos are forks of a template, owners can pull in updates via Git
  * treat small data sets (e.g., inflammation data) as part of the base template
* what about software setup instructions?
  * can't put in central site: really want a single page _that instructors can customize_
  * so duplicate for now and figure it out later
* problems addressed:
  * bc repo is too big: addressed.
  * scope creep: avoids problem by removing binary in/out distinction for lesson materials
  * some lessons don't work well: not directly addressed, but this approach makes experimentation easier

## Next Steps

* Define _simple_ template for lessons
  * filename conventions, directory layout, manifest file, etc.
  * must accommodate files in different source formats
  * _or_ template only specifies Markdown; everything else is up to the author(s) to maintain
* Create tool to:
  * Generate new files in the right places with the right names
  * Check that files are consistent with format requirements
  * Similar in spirit to tools like django-admin and to bin/swc_index_validator.py in the bc repo

## Straw Man Template

Each lesson is in a directory, and may include multiple topics.

* index.md : home page for lesson
* dd-slug.md : topics (where 'dd' is a sequence number and 'slug' is a mnemonic, e.g., 03-functions.md)
* introduction.md : slides for 3-minute "why learn this?" presentation
* glossary.md : definitions of key terms
* reference.md : cheat sheet for key commands, etc.
* guide.md : instructor's guide
* code/ : sub-directory containing all code samples, which are executed from the root directory
* data/ : sub-directory containing all data specific to this lesson
  * index.md : describes data sets
  * filename.xyz : single-file dataset
  * folder/ : multi-file datasets are all in their own directories
* img/ : images (including plots) used in lesson

### Overall Index

The index.md file is structured as follows:

    # Lesson Title

    Paragraph of introductory material.

    > ## Learning Objectives
    >
    > * Overall objective 1
    > * Overall objective 2

    ## Topics

    * [Topic Title](dd-slug.html)
    * [Topic Title](dd-slug.html)

    ## Other Resources

    * [Introduction](intro.html)
    * [Glossary](glossary.html)
    * [Reference Guide](reference.html)
    * [Instructor's Guide](guide.html)

### Topics

Each topic file's name is dd-slug.md, where 'dd' is a sequence number
and 'slug' is a mnenominc, e.g., '03-functions.md'.  Each topic should
take 10-30 minutes to cover, and should be structured as follows:

    # Topic Title

    > ## Learning Objectives {.objectives}
    >
    > * Learning objective 1
    > * Learning objective 2

    Paragraphs of introductory material.

    ## Sub-heading

    Paragraphs of text.

    ~~~ {.python}
    some code:
        to be displayed
    ~~~
    ~~~ {.output}
    output
    from
    program
    ~~~

    > ## Challenge Title {.challenge}
    >
    > Description of challenge

    ## Another Sub-heading

    As above...

    > ## Key Points {.keypoints}
    >
    > * Key point 1
    > * Key point 2

Some features of this are:

* We will use Pandoc for Markdown-to-HTML conversion, so we can use
  {.attribute} syntax for specifying things instead of the clunky
  postfix syntax our current notes use (because it's the only thing
  that Jekyll supports).

* Rather than using <div class="whatever">...</div> to mark sections,
  this uses blockquotes whose headings have specific classes - the
  sections we need to mark are relatively small, and CSS will take
  care of displaying these the way we want.

### Glossary

Each term in the glossary is laid out as a separate blockquote, with
the term in a heading.  Yes, this is odd, but we want to avoid putting
HTML in Markdown, and we can't add identifiers to paragraphs using
{#whatever} notation - that only works on headers.

    # Glossary

    > ## Term {#some-anchor}
    > The definition.
    > See also: [some word](#local-anchor)

### Introductory Slides

Every lesson must come with a short slide deck (2-3 minutes)
explaining what the subject is, how knowing it will help learners, and
what's going to be covered.  Slides are written in Markdown, and
compiled into HTML using reveal.js.

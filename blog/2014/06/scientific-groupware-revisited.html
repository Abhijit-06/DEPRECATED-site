<h2>Internet Groupware for Scientific Collaboration</h2>
<p><b>by Jon Udell</b></p>
<p><b>June 2000</b></p>
</div>
<a name="2">
</a><p><a name="2">
The Web was invented so that scientists could use computer networks to 
collaborate -- that is, exchange documents, discuss them, coordinate 
work, create and publish collective knowledge. It was, in other words, 
supposed to be a groupware application.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">2</font></p>


<a name="3">
</a><p><a name="3">
Despite the popularity of the Web -- or, perhaps, because of that 
popularity -- it has yet to fulfill that original mission. Today's Web 
is more like a shotgun marriage of electronic publishing and broadcast 
television than it is like an engineered solution for group 
collaboration. True, the Internet empowers today's working scientist in 
ways only dreamed of even a decade ago. Yet our use of it often remains 
rooted in pre-Web idioms and habits -- partly because we don't fully 
exploit today's Internet communication tools, but mainly because we're 
still missing key tools and infrastructure. Consider some of the routine
 daily activities of a working scientist circa 2000:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">3</font></p>

<a name="4">
</a><p><a name="4">
<b>Scheduling a meeting with a team of colleages.</b> The meeting 
organizer contacts the target group by email. Negotiation of time and 
venue involves a tedious series of email exchanges which carry both 
structured data (accept/reject/postpone) and unstructured communication 
(agenda-setting, politicking). The Internet is utilized solely as a 
message transport. The messaging software has no understanding of the 
event-scheduling protocol, does not capture or represent the consensus 
of the group, and cannot shield participants from the low-level message 
flow in order to focus their attention on its outcome. The meeting 
organizer has to process and make sense of the raw message flow, unaided
 by any meaningful software support.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">4</font></p>

<a name="5">
</a><p><a name="5">
Of course, conventional scheduling behavior -- popping into people's 
offices, calling them on the phone -- never was automatable by software.
 But as one scientist interviewed for this report remarked wistfully, 
that mattered less when personal assistants were available to do these 
chores. Those assistants are harder to come by nowadays. So we expect 
the Web not just to "do things faster" but to "do more things."
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">5</font></p>


<a name="6">
</a><p><a name="6">
<b>Discussing issues with a team of colleagues.</b> When groups can't 
meet face-to-face, the most well-funded may enjoy access to a 
videoconferencing facility. Others rely on telephone conference calls. 
But realtime video- and audio-conferencing modes must always be 
augmented by written communication. Email is the mode of choice, but for
 many reasons it makes a poor tool for group discussion.
When messages are simply cc'd among members of the team, there's no 
central transcript and the conversational thread is easily lost. When 
messages are relayed through email aliases or listservs things are a bit
 better but, as we'll see, these shared spaces fail to organize group 
messaging in the most effective ways.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">6</font></p>


<a name="7">
</a><p><a name="7">
<b>Monitoring the activities of colleagues in your own and related fields</b>.
In scientific collaboration, everybody has to mind everybody else's 
business. You pay close attention to what your immediate colleagues are 
doing, and try to at least keep in touch with more distant colleagues 
and related disciplines. Thanks to the Internet the problem here is no 
longer lack of information. Quite the reverse. We are flooded with more 
information than we can process. Much of it comes, again, in the form of
 a torrent of email. "I need to join some more lists," said one 
scientist interviewed for this report, "but I can't begin to keep up 
with the ones I'm already on."
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">7</font></p>

<a name="8">
</a><p><a name="8">
<b>Publishing a scientific paper.</b> Typically the author writes the 
draft in Microsoft Word or, if math-intensive, FrameMaker or TeX. Often,
 he or she then emails the draft to reviewers. Responses come back as 
versions of the document with revision marking (in the case of Word), or
 email messages referring to parts of the document. Once submitted, the 
paper may be made available online -- for example, as part of the 
e-print archive at </a><a href="http://www.arxiv.org/">http://www.arxiv.org</a>
 (formerly xxx.lanl.gov). Interested parties use the Internet to 
communicate during the preparation of the paper, and after its 
publication, but such collaboration is constrained by the fact that the 
document is never written in, and rarely read in, the Web's native HTML 
format. Particularly tragic, in this regard, is HTML's inability to 
express mathematical notation.
 <font color="green" size="-2">8</font></p>

<a name="9">
</a><p><a name="9">
An ideal implementation of Internet groupware would enable us to work in shared electronic spaces that:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">9</font></p>

<ul>
<li><a name="10">
</a><p><a name="10">are created ad-hoc, without the help of a central authority </a><font color="green" size="-2">10</font></p></li>

<li><a name="11">
</a><p><a name="11">are accessible with free, universally-available software </a><font color="green" size="-2">11</font></p></li>

<li><a name="12">
</a><p><a name="12">are equally accessible to colleagues both inside and outside the firewall </a><font color="green" size="-2">12</font></p></li>

<li><a name="13">
</a><p><a name="13">can be strongly encrypted </a><font color="green" size="-2">13</font></p></li>

<li><a name="14">
</a><p><a name="14">are backed by a rich, transactional data store </a><font color="green" size="-2">14</font></p></li>

</ul>

<a name="15">
</a><p><a name="15">
These shared spaces would support applications that:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">15</font></p>

<ul>

<li><a name="16">
</a><p><a name="16">fluidly integrate rich text, equations, vector and raster images, voice, and video </a><font color="green" size="-2">16</font></p></li>

<li><a name="17">
</a><p><a name="17">are made of standard components </a><font color="green" size="-2">17</font></p></li>

<li><a name="18">
</a><p><a name="18">represent data in a standard way </a><font color="green" size="-2">18</font></p></li>

<li><a name="19">
</a><p><a name="19">encapsulate collaborative protocols (event scheduling, discussion, document review, project planning) </a><font color="green" size="-2">19</font></p></li>

<li><a name="20">
</a><p><a name="20">help people focus attention on the "important" stuff </a><font color="green" size="-2">20</font></p></li>

</ul>

<a name="21">
</a><p><a name="21">
Nobody would argue against these principles. But how will we get from 
here to there, and when? This report considers a number of products, 
services, technologies, and techniques that, collectively, suggest both 
near-term and longer-term answers to these questions.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">21</font></p>

<a name="22">
</a><p><a name="22">
The report divides into four sections:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">22</font></p>

<ol>

<li>
<a name="23">
</a><p><a name="23">
<b>Event Coordination</b>.
When we schedule meetings we eventually agree on a time, a place, and a 
group of participants. But the protocol isn't just about synchronizing 
calendars. It also involves discussion and negotiation. Web-based 
services can help us manage both the structured and semi-structured 
aspects of event coordination. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">23</font></p>
 </li>

<li>
<a name="24">
</a><p><a name="24">
<b>Group Discussion</b>. 
Mailing lists, the dominant mode of group messaging, are problematic. 
Fortunately there are a variety of alternatives that can make shared 
discussion spaces easier to create, and more effective to use.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">24</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="25">
</a><p><a name="25">
<b>Broadcasting and Monitoring News</b>. 
The physics e-print archive at www.arxiv.org has transformed the way 
scientists publicize their own work, and monitor the work of colleagues.
 A new standard for content syndication on the web can generalize and 
extend this process.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">25</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="26">
</a><p><a name="26">
<b>Scientific Publishing</b>. 
TeX and LaTeX define scientific publishing for a generation of 
scientists. But these formats don't integrate directly into the shared 
spaces of the Web. The rise of XML as a universal markup language, along
 with vocabularies such as MathML (for mathematical notation) and SVG 
(for scalable vector graphics), suggests that the Web may yet reach its 
original collaborative goal.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">26</font></p>
</li>




</ol>



<h3>1 Event Coordination</h3>

<a name="27">
</a><p><a name="27">
There are now a number of free (advertising-supported) web services that
 can help streamline the communication effort required to coordinate an 
event. They include:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">27</font></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://invites.yahoo.com/">invites.yahoo.com</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.evite.com/">www.evite.com</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.timedance.com/">www.timedance.com</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="28">
</a><p><a name="28">
Using any of these services you can create an "event object" in web 
space, and specify email addresses of people you want to invite to the 
event. (To simplify that chore, these services can import a variety of 
common address-book formats.) The services automatically mail 
invitations which embed URLs that lead back to the shared space, in a 
context that enables automatic tabulation of RSVPs and that supports 
group discussion (e.g., a message board) for negotation of time, venue, 
and agenda.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">28</font></p>

<a name="29">
</a><p><a name="29">
Let's look at one of the more sophisticated implementations, TimeDance, 
in more detail. If I'm coordinating an event, and want to offer a choice
 of times, the protocol goes like this:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">29</font></p>

<ul>

<li>
<a name="30">
</a><p><a name="30">
I propose a list of possible times to a list of invitees. Although I 
seed the list with email addresses, I may also opt to delegate the task 
of inviting others. When an invitation is configured this way, anyone 
can add names to the invitation -- very helpful when I want to invite 
people, don't know their email addresses, but suspect that others do.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">30</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="31">
</a><p><a name="31">
TimeDance polls invitees regarding these times. Each of these polling 
messages contains a uniquely-coded URL so that, when you click through 
to the polling page on the site, it knows who you are.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">31</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="32">
</a><p><a name="32">
Each invitee rates each proposed time as "Great" or "So-So" or "Not Good."
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">32</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="33">
</a><p><a name="33">
During the negotiation phase, the event's web page shows its status as 
"people are voting on times," and -- crucially -- the discussion board 
is available to support freeform negotiation.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">33</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="34">
</a><p><a name="34">
When everyone has voted, TimeDance alerts me by email, passing an URL to
 a web page on which it has collated the results. Time slots when 
everyone is available show up as green lights. Any slot can be selected 
to display a map of all users' preferences for that slot.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">34</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="35">
</a><p><a name="35">
TimeDance proposes a "best" time, and asks me to choose it (or another) and announce to the group.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">35</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="36">
</a><p><a name="36">
TimeDance rebroadcasts the now-scheduled invitation and begins the RSVP 
phase.  Again each message contains a custom URL that leads you into a 
personalized space. If this is a physical meeting rather than, say, a 
teleconferece, you'll see its location, and can view a map (if TimeDance
 was able to look up the address). You'll also find a link that you can 
use to add the event to an Outlook, Netscape, or other vCard-aware 
calendar. (vCard is a standard for exchanging calendar data. See the 
Internet Mail Consortium at http://www/pdi.org/ for more information.)
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">36</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="37">
</a><p><a name="37">
To RSVP, you announce your plans ("Attending", "Not Attending", "Not 
Sure"). Again, the discussion board is available so that invitees can 
converse. One of the things affecting your decision to attend (or not) 
is the list of invitees, and their intentions. If the event organizer 
told TimeDance to make this information available, then it does so. 
You'll see a summary of the number of people in each of four categories:
 "Attending", "Not Attending", "Not Sure", and "Not Responded Yet". And 
you'll see the lists of names and address associated with each of these 
groups. This is a really powerful feature, which enables the event 
coordinator (or anyone else) to communicate with each of these 
dynamically-maintained lists. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">37</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="38">
</a><p><a name="38">
The event's web page (which is by default private, but can be made 
public) now tracks the RSVP process. It monitors who's in each category,
 and continues to support group discussion.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">38</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="39">
</a><p><a name="39">
If configured to do so, TimeDance will remind non-responders to respond, and will remind confirmed attendees to attend. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">39</font></p>
</li>

</ul>

<a name="40">
</a><p><a name="40">
TimeDance is an outstanding example of Internet groupware circa 2000. Here are the reasons that make it so:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">40</font></p>

<ul>

<li><b>Runs as a service.</b>
<a name="41">
</a><p><a name="41">
There's no software to install; users simply bookmark the application.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">41</font></p>
</li>

<li><b>Has a low activation threshold.</b>
<a name="42">
</a><p><a name="42">
An event coordinator has to register with the service, but once 
registered can create a new invitation with very little effort. Invitees
 need not even register; anyone who's invited can vote, discuss, and 
RSVP. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">42</font></p>
</li>

<li><b>Uses, but does not abuse, email.</b>
<a name="43">
</a><p><a name="43">
A lot of the pain felt by email users results from the failure of 
messaging protocols to regard personal email as a priority communication
 channel. TimeDance laudably sends email on a strictly "need to know" 
basis. Invitees need to receive email when polled for a time, or when 
asked to RSVP, or when a planned time changes. But <i>not</i> when 
someone RSVPs, or posts a message to the board. Quite a lot of messaging
 can occur within TimeDance, but it's confined to the event's shared 
space where it belongs. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">43</font></p>
</li>

<li><b>Is a practical and effective web/email hybrid.</b>
<a name="44">
</a><p><a name="44">
Messaging is a fundamental activity that, by rights, ought to be 
supported by a platform as fully customizable and programmable as the 
web browser. Unfortately email infrastructure is not (yet) that 
flexible. So today's Internet groupware often resorts to an awkward 
mixture of email for communication, and the web for application features
 not possible (or at any rate, not universally supported) in email 
clients. TimeDance strikes the right balance. It expects that your mail 
program will auto-activate (that is, make clickable) the URL it sends 
you, and it intelligently keeps the URL short enough to avoid the 
line-breaking that ruins this effect. But in case of a text-only reader 
such as <tt>pine</tt>, you can easily capture the URL and transfer it to a browser.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">44</font></p>
</li>

<li><b>Automates key administrative chores.</b>
<a name="45">
</a><p><a name="45">
Polling for open time slots, collating RSVPs, and setting up a message 
board plus multiple mailing lists are activities that can eat up more of
 a highly-paid scientist's time than he or she cares to admit. At the 
level of use for which TimeDance is appropriate -- say, for events 
involving more than two or three people, fewer than fifty or one hundred
 -- it automates these things rather nicely.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">45</font></p>
</li>

<li><b>Does "context assembly" </b>
<a name="46">
</a><p><a name="46">
When conventional email is the medium for event coordination, everybody 
has to keep track of everything related to the event -- the invitation 
itself, related documents such as maps, discussion messages. Email 
filtering can be used to funnel the message traffic into a designated 
inbox folder, but not everyone can or will go to the trouble. Unless the
 email is archived and web-visible, anyone who joins the list late will 
have missed the early discussion. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">46</font></p>

<a name="47">
</a><p><a name="47">
There's an urgent (if largely unarticulated) need for software to help 
us assemble all these bits of information into a meaningful context. 
Lacking such software, we enact collaborative protocols the hard way. 
Because our computers don't know about events <i>as events</i>, we do 
the context assembly -- keeping track of who's responded, separating 
event-related discussion from other discussion, remembering where we put
 the invitation and the map -- in our heads. This requires time and 
effort not only of the coordinator, but of all involved parties. A 
service such as TimeDance shows how things ought to work. Because it 
embodies a collaborative protocol, it wraps meaningful context around 
what would otherwise be a disparate set of documents and messages.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">47</font></p>

</li>

</ul>

<h3>2 Group Discussion</h3>

<a name="48">
</a><p><a name="48">
Mailing lists are the de facto standard for group discussion conducted 
in written form. The advantages are clear. It's easy to create a mailing
 list, especially now that Web-based services such as </a><a href="http://www.egroups.com/">http://www.egroups.com/</a> (free, advertising-supported) and <a href="http://www.lyris.net/">http://www.lyris.net/</a>
 (commercial, but inexpensive) can handle all the server administration 
for you -- including list management, digest delivery, and searchable 
web archiving. Of course anyone can join a mailing list, using any 
Internet mail program.
 <font color="green" size="-2">48</font></p>

<a name="49">
</a><p><a name="49">
But mailing lists aren't the best, or only, shared spaces for group discussion. Here are some of the problems:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">49</font></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Mailing lists are awkward web/email hybrids</b>
<a name="50">
</a><p><a name="50">
Email is distributed for delivery, but recentralized (in web archives) 
for navigation and search. So it's unclear what, exactly, is the shared 
space that list members occupy. Is it the collection of members' 
individual mailboxes, or the web archive, or both? Some web archives 
allow full participation, others support only reading and searching. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">50</font></p>
</li>

<li><b>Mailing lists aren't easily secured</b>
<a name="51">
</a><p><a name="51">
End-to-end encryption of email, using PGP or S/MIME, is widely 
available. But mail encryption is poorly understood, not widely used for
 interpersonal mail, and logistically unworkable for mailing lists 
accessed by a variety of mail programs and (in archival form) by 
browsers. And, because the shared space created by a mailing list 
propagates to many hard disks, it's inherently difficult to secure.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">51</font></p>
</li>


<li><b>Email is not a rich medium for discourse</b>
<a name="52">
</a><p><a name="52">
Within the constraints of the fixed-line-length ASCII email message, 
there is a very powerful tool: the URL. Most mailreaders can 
automatically render URLs clickable. This ability to cite rich web-based
 sources merely by naming them has radically expanded the expressive 
power of email. But email discussion only refers to such documents. It 
does not, in general, create them.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">52</font></p>
</li>

<li><b>Mailing lists don't layer information effectively</b>
<a name="53">
</a><p><a name="53">
Newspaper and journal editors have for many years chanted the mantra 
"heads, decks, and leads." They assume that noboby has time to read 
everything, and that each published item must be packaged in layers. The
 headline tells the story in a few words; the deck (subtitle) in a 
sentence; the lead (abstract) in a paragraph. In some contexts there may
 be only enough space to display the headline; in other contexts all the
 elements may appear. The layered architecture componentizes the story. 
Publishers can then select and arrange these components so as to 
maximize that scarcest of resources: the attention of the reader. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">53</font></p>
<a name="54">
</a><p><a name="54">
Email, as a publishing medium, fails disastrously to afford this kind of
 layering. When you scan an inbox or mail archive, only the message's 
title -- that is, its Subject: header -- describes the message, and 
provides a clue as to whether or not to invest more time and effort in 
reading it. Unfortunately, because of habit and a longstanding problem 
with email threading, the titles are almost invariably used only to 
indicate threading. The resulting <i>cascading Re: syndrome</i>, which 
drains titles of their descriptive power, can be seen everywhere -- in 
your own inbox, and on countless mailing lists. Here, for example, is a 
typical mailing-list snapshot, from the </a><a href="http://lists.zope.org/pipermail/zope-dev/2000-April/thread.html">Zope developers'</a> list:

In light of Figure 2, Figure 1 is a disastrous information display. Its 
rendering of thread structure is virtually useless in the absence of 
descriptive message titles. Claude Shannon defined information as what 
you don't know -- the degree to which the next message in a series of 
messages surprises you. In Figure 1, the repetition of "ZServer speed 
enhancement (I hope)" is completely unsurprising. This sequence of 
message titles literally carries no information -- yet it's the only 
available interface to the underlying content.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">58</font></p>
<a name="59">
</a><p><a name="59">
The difference between Figure 1 and Figure 2 could not be more dramatic.
 In Figure 2 you can click through to the individual messages, but you 
don't <i>have</i> to click through to absorb the sense of this thread. The message titles themselves convey information; they tell a story.

<a name="60">
</a><p><a name="60">
This might seem like a pedantic point, but if you've ever spent time 
trying to dig information out of mailing lists (and who hasn't?), you 
can see that the cascading Re: syndrome is responsible for catastrophic 
information loss and inefficiency. Mailing lists just aren't effectively
 scannable. It's only practical to read lists on which traffic is 
sufficiently light (and valuable) to warrant sustained attention. 
Digests that deliver titles only are of limited use when most titles 
carry no meaning. Likewise web archives of mailing lists, since indexed 
views (and search results) are mainly lists of redundant titles.

We'd all like our mailboxes to look like Figure 2. But clearly, we all 
aren't inclined to think and act like publishers and editors. There's no
 simple solution to this problem. One part of the answer is 
sociocultural. As a species, we have very little experience inhabiting 
the kinds of shared spaces made possible by Internet group messaging. We
 are now discovering that verbal pollution of the information highway is
 as unpleasant as litter on the real highway. Just as we explain the 
rules of the road to high-school-aged students, we may decide that we 
ought to explain to these same people how to communicate concisely and 
effectively on the Internet.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">61</font></p>

<a name="62">
</a><p><a name="62">
Another part of the answer is technical. Our messaging software needs to
 understand that useful shared spaces require certain kinds of 
behaviors, and it needs to find ways to encourage and support those 
behaviors.

<li><b>Mailing lists often cannot thread messages properly</b>
<a name="63">
</a><p><a name="63">
Mail threading organizes sets of messages by topic. One of two message headers -- <tt>References:</tt> (for email and newsgroups) or <tt>In-Reply-To:</tt>
 (for email) -- relates a message to one or more antecedents. Most email
 programs now emit one or both of these headers when replying to a 
message, and can use these headers to display sets of related messages 
in threaded fashion. But this wasn't always true, and still isn't for 
some email programs. So, while there in principle is no need to rely on 
the <tt>Subject:</tt> to relate a message to its topic, in practice the 
habit is almost universal. Because there are two contradictory uses of 
the all-important <tt>Subject:</tt> header -- to entitle a message, and 
to relate a message to its surrounding context -- mail programs and mail
 archivers are often unable to display threads properly. And in any 
case, as we've seen, threaded displays typically convey structure but 
little meaning.

<h4>2.1 Alternatives to mailing lists</h4>

<h5>2.1.1 NNTP newsgroups</h5>

<a name="64">
</a><p><a name="64">
This year, the Usenet celebrates its 20th anniversary. It's the 
grandfather of all groupware systems: a planetary discussion network 
that supports tens of thousands of virtual communities. At their best, 
these shared spaces enable groups of like-minded individuals to 
collaborate rather effectively. At their worst, they're overrun by spam,
 smut, and nonsense. This degradation poisons our notion of the Usenet 
and, what's worse, prevents us from fully understanding and exploiting 
some really useful, and well-established, collaborative tools -- NNTP 
(Net News Transfer Protocol) servers and clients.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">64</font></p>

<a name="65">
</a><p><a name="65">
We can, and probably should, re-invent the Usenet. Even when it works 
well -- there are, for example, many high-quality moderated Usenet 
groups -- its replication scheme has become terribly inefficient. Any 
given Usenet node receives and processes vastly more messages than 
anyone attached to that node will ever read. Why? When the Usenet grew 
up, there was no such thing as a near-universal real-time-connected data
 network. Replication was the only way to propagate messages worldwide 
over diverse and intermittently-connected networks. Today newsreaders 
can connect instantaneously to many different news servers, just as 
browsers connect to many different Web sites. 

 </a><font color="green" size="-2">65</font></p>

<a name="66">
</a><p><a name="66">
Let's imagine an alternative Usenet. It has the same number of virtual 
communities and the same number of nodes. But each node is responsible 
for just one or several shared spaces, not all of them. (NNTP 
replication might still mirror nodes to a few locations around the 
world, to improve local access, but the storage and processing costs of 
replication would be vastly reduced.) When each node processes vastly 
fewer messages, the focus can shift from quantity to quality. Here are 
some of the implications:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">66</font></p>

<ul>
<li>
<a name="67">
</a><p><a name="67">
Messages need never expire, so each newsgroup remembers messages for years rather than days.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">67</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="68">
</a><p><a name="68">
Because messages never expire, they define a persistent URL namespace.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">68</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="69">
</a><p><a name="69">
An editor -- the person who today maintains the newsgroup's FAQ file -- 
can create views of that persistent namespace. These views can select, 
summarize, and annotate landmark contributions.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">69</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="70">
</a><p><a name="70">
Search can be optimized for the characteristics of a particular newsgroup and its associated knowledge domain.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">70</font></p>
</li>

</ul>

<a name="71">
</a><p><a name="71">
Whether or not the Usenet reorganizes along these lines, it's crucial to
 separate the idea of shared discussion space from its implementation as
 the Usenet. The Usenet's model of collaboration -- and its existing, 
proven tools and technologies -- can be redeployed on public sites, 
extranets, and intranets. NNTP conferencing can be a better kind of 
mailing list, one that supports the kinds of collaboration that the Web 
has so far failed to deliver. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">71</font></p>

<a name="72">
</a><p><a name="72">
NNTP servers, notably the standard UNIX INND (InterNet News Daemon), are
 freely available. Such servers are widely thought to require wizardry 
but, in fact, the only hard part is keeping the newsfeeds running. And 
there's no need to do that. You don't need to replicate with the Usenet 
in order to access to it; services such as </a><a href="http://www.dejanews.com/usenet/">http://www.dejanews.com/usenet/</a> and <a href="http://www.remarq.com/">http://www.remarq.com/</a>
 serve up Usenet content and support Usenet interaction. Deploying news 
service locally -- to support non-Usenet mailing-list-like discussions 
-- turns out to be very easy. The news spool can be indexed, for 
searching, just like any collection of web pages or mail messages. 
Newsgroups can be password-protected just as web archives can be. It's 
straightforward to create secure channels for traffic flowing between a 
news server and a population of newsreaders.
 <font color="green" size="-2">72</font></p>

<a name="73">
</a><p><a name="73">
For sites running Windows NT, the NNTP Service included with the NT 
Option Pack is an underappreciated gem. It's very easy to use, and 
highly functional. Little time or skill is required to set up a 
discussion server that accepts secure connections, supports fulltext 
search, can be divided into multiple zones of privacy, and can integrate
 with the Windows NT user directory. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">73</font></p>

<h6>Benefits of newsreader-based discussion</h6>

<a name="74">
</a><p><a name="74">
Like NNTP servers, NNTP newsreaders are underappreciated resources for 
collaboration. Most people know that the Microsoft and Netscape 
newsreaders can post plain-text messages to newsgroups, and attach 
binary files. But newsreaders offers some other, less widely-appreciated
 collaborative benefits vis-a-vis mailing lists:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">74</font></p>

<ul>

<li>
<b>Single message base, single interface.</b>
<a name="75">
</a><p><a name="75">
Mailing lists are distributed, and the interface to them is multi-modal.
 One consequence is that a new participant who goes to a web archive to 
review prior discussion can't also join in that prior discussion. In the
 case of a newsgroup, discussion is fully available to anyone at any 
time, using the same mechanism for reading and writing.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">75</font></p>
</li>


<li>
<b>Effective threading.</b>
<a name="76">
</a><p><a name="76">
Newsgroups manage threaded views more effectively than mailing lists 
because newsreaders are more consistent in their use of the <tt>References:</tt>
 header. This doesn't, however, automatically solve the "cascading Re: 
problem." Like archived views of mailing lists, newsgroups are usefully 
scannable only if participants understand, and exploit, the principle of
 descriptive message titling. When users are so inclined, an NNTP 
discussion server supports the technique better than a mailing list 
typically can.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">76</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<b>Rich messages.</b>
<a name="77">
</a><p><a name="77">
In both the Netscape and Microsoft newsreaders you can, in a WYSIWYG 
manner, compose HTML that uses tables, inline images (which can be 
dragged and dropped into place), hyperlinks, fonts, and color. You can't
 do these things in Usenet postings, because many people don't run 
HTML-aware mail/news clients. But rich messaging can be appropriate in a
 collaborative environment where these tools are universally deployed.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">77</font></p>
<a name="78">
</a><p><a name="78">
Is this a gratuitous use of HTML? Is plain line-oriented ASCII text 
sufficient for scientific collaboration? Traditionally it has been, and 
first-generation HTML messaging has been admittedly almost as 
problematic as beneficial. For many scientific collaborators today, TeX 
attachments are a good-enough solution. But today's HTML email isn't the
 end-game for rich-text messaging. XML vocabularies such as MathML and 
SVG (see section 4 below) are gaining ground. Few would deny the benefit
 of ubiquitous messaging tools that natively understand mathematical 
equations and illustrations as well as rich text. As we'll see, the 
infrastructure needed to support such tools is emerging, and it's 
reasonable to expect to able to use these tools within a few years.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">78</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<b>Secure communication.</b>
<a name="79">
</a><p><a name="79">
People often worry about the level of encryption that protects their 
credit-card numbers when they order from an e-commerce website. The same
 people rarely worry about sending unencrypted confidential 
communication through a whole chain of SMTP email routers. We ought to 
be able to hold confidential discussions in secure shared spaces, and 
properly-configured NNTP newsgroups can meet that requirement.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">79</font></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h5>2.1.2 QuickTopic</h5>

<a name="80">
</a><p><a name="80">
As useful as private (that is, non-Usenet) NNTP discussions can be, they
 fail to meet one of the requirements for an ideal collaborative 
solution. Most people can't form NNTP discussion spaces on the fly, 
without the help of a central authority. An innovative service, </a><a href="http://www.quicktopic.com/">http://www.QuickTopic.com/</a>
 (formerly www.TakeItOffline.com), tackles precisely this problem. It's a
 web/email hybrid that creates "instant discussion spaces" each focused 
on a single topic
 <font color="green" size="-2">80</font></p>

<a name="81">
</a><p><a name="81">
To use QuickTopic you visit the site, name and describe your discussion 
topic, and provide your email address. The site creates a discussion 
space, and emails you an URL referring to it. To recruit others into the
 discussion, you forward them this message (or just the URL). Topics are
 shown in a linear style without threading, but you can create a new 
topic and link it to an existing one to create a branching effect.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">81</font></p>

<a name="82">
</a><p><a name="82">
How private are these discussions? The documentation frankly explains:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">82</font></p>

<blockquote><i>
Your topic at Take It Offline is just as private as
its web address -- no more, no less. This address
is extremly hard to guess. It's a randomly
generated series of alphanumeric characters 
</i></blockquote>

<a name="83">
</a><p><a name="83">
This URL-is-the-password solution is fine for many kinds of
casual use. More rigorous security protocols are of course
possible. It would be easy to encrypt the web component of QuickTopic,
though much harder to encrypt the email component while preserving the
spontaneity that is a key strength of the system.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">83</font></p>

<a name="84">
</a><p><a name="84">
QuickTopic was designed not to replace the mailing list, but to augment 
it. Mailing lists, newsgroups, and web forums are best suited for 
long-term collaboration. These solutions tend to be too heavy, and too 
static, for the kinds of ad-hoc, short-lived interactions that 
characterize so much of our real collaborative work. In these situations
 we invariably use email, despite its limitations, because it comes 
easily to hand. Like the single-topic bulletin board associated with a 
TimeDance event, a QuickTopic instant discussion is ad-hoc, lightweight 
and disposable, yet more focused, more centralized, and more accessible 
than a mailing list.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">84</font></p>

<h5>2.1.3 Roundup and "nosy lists"</h5>

<a name="85">
</a><p><a name="85">
Ka-Ping Yee's </a><a href="http://software-carpentry.codesourcery.com/entries/track/Roundup/Roundup.html">Roundup</a>
 
(http://software-carpentry.codesourcery.com/entries/track/Roundup/Roundup.html),
 an entry in the Software Carpentry project's tracking category, 
proposes a mechanism for single-topic, ad-hoc discussion called the 
"nosy list," which works like this:
 <font color="green" size="-2">85</font></p>

<blockquote><i>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<a name="86">
</a><p><a name="86">
New items are always submitted by sending an e-mail message
to Roundup.  The "Subject:" field becomes the description
of the new item.
The message is saved in the mail spool of the new item,
and copied to the list of all participants
so everyone knows that a new item has been added.
The new item's nosy list initially contains the submitter.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">86</font></p>
</li>
<li>
<a name="87">
</a><p><a name="87">
All e-mail messages sent by Roundup have their "Reply-To:"
field set to Roundup's address, and have the item's
number in the "Subject:" field.  Thus, any replies to the
initial announcement and subsequent threads are all received
by Roundup.  Roundup notes the item number in the "Subject:"
field of each incoming message and appends the message
to the appropriate spool.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">87</font></p>
</li>
<li>
<a name="88">
</a><p><a name="88">
Any incoming e-mail tagged with an item number is copied
to all the people on the item's nosy list,
and any users found in the "From:", "To:", or "Cc:" fields
are automatically added to the nosy list.  Whenever a user
edits an item's properties in the Web interface, they are
also added to the nosy list.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">88</font></p>
</li>
</ol>

<a name="89">
</a><p><a name="89">
The effect is like each item having its own little mailing list,
except that no one ever has to worry about subscribing to
anything.  Indicating interest in an issue is sufficient, and if you
want to bring someone new into the conversation, all you need to do
is Cc: a message to them.  It turns out that no one ever has to worry
about unsubscribing, either: the nosy lists are so specific in scope
that the conversation tends to die down by itself when the issue is
resolved or people no longer find it sufficiently important.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">89</font></p>

<a name="90">
</a><p><a name="90">
Using many small, specific mailing lists results
in much more effective communication than one big list.
Taking away the effort of subscribing and unsubscribing
gives these lists the "feel" of being cheap and
disposable.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">90</font></p>
<a name="91">
</a><p><a name="91">
The transparent capture of the mail spool attached to each
issue also yields a nice knowledge repository over time.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">91</font></p>
</i></blockquote>

<a name="92">
</a><p><a name="92">
This strategy is powerful because it leverages, and adds value to, 
existing tools and habits. Messaging, in this system, occurs within a 
well-defined context -- a specific project, a specific issue related to 
that project. Like TimeDance, Roundup proposes to keep track of context 
so users don't have to.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">92</font></p>

<h5>2.1.4 WikiWiki tools</h5>

<a name="93">
</a><p><a name="93">
Threaded messaging isn't the only model for online discussion. A popular
 alternative is WikiWiki (Hawaiian for "fast"), a freeform collaboration
 tool that prefers hypertextual structure to thread structure. The 
original WikiWiki, a collaboration among programmers that's still 
ongoing at the </a><a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors">Portland Pattern Repository</a>
 (http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors) is a radical experiment: a
 collection of online documents that are always editable by everyone.
 <font color="green" size="-2">93</font></p>

<a name="94">
</a><p><a name="94">
There are two key features of the Wiki editing environment:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">94</font></p>

<ul>

<li>
<a name="95">
</a><p><a name="95">
<b>New documents are automatically conjured into existence.</b> 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">95</font></p>
<a name="96">
</a><p><a name="96">
While mailing-list messages can refer to existing Web content (by citing
 URLs), they cannot, in general, create new Web content. In the Wiki 
environment, specially-written <i>WikiNames</i> -- which are just 
mixed-case, run-together phrases -- support automatic hypertext 
authoring. If I type the phrase "BibliographicalReferences" in a Wiki 
page, it will be rendered initially like this:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">96</font></p>
<pre>BibliographicalReferences</a>
</pre>
</a><p><a name="97">
Now the phrase is an invitation to create a new document of that name. 
Anyone can create that document by clicking the linked question mark and
 typing something into the editor. Once that's done, the phrase 
"BibliographicalReferences" will be rendered, in all pages belonging to 
this Wiki collection, like so:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">97</font></p>
<pre></a>
</pre>
</a><p><a name="98">
Like URLs in email messages, these WikiNames are automatically rendered 
as clickable links to Web pages. But here, the process of creating the 
document addressed by the link has been automated.

Wiki doesn't really do away with markup, it just simplifies it. In the

asterisk for a first-level item, two tabs plus an asterisk for a 
second-level item, and so on. In the second example, leading space tells
 the formatter to render code (monospaced font, line-oriented) rather 
than text (proportional font, paragraph-oriented).

<h5>2.1.5 Wiki clones</h5>

<a name="110">
</a><p><a name="110">
The original Wiki spawned a slew of </a><a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiClones">derivatives</a>. For example, if you're running a Zope site, you can install <a href="http://www.zope.org/Members/simon/ZWiki">ZWiki</a>, which enables Zope to host one or more Wiki webs. Another variant, called <a href="http://twiki.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/view/Codev/WebHome">TWiki</a>,
 addresses one of the concerns about classic Wiki, which is that its 
egalitarian "edit every page" philosophy leaves no change log. TWiki 
includes powerful revision support. Every change leaves a footprint, and
 you can follow these easily and effectively.

<h4>2.2 Review of group messaging options</h4>

<a name="111">
</a><p><a name="111">
Mailing lists will not, and should not, go away. They serve a vital 
purpose. But the old adage is relevant here: when the only tool you have
 is a hammer, every problem starts to look like a nail. For many modes 
of collaboration, the conventional mailing list is not the appropriate 
tool. Which alternative is best? That depends sensitively on a 
combination of variables. The technical characteristics of newsgroups, 
Wikis, and other alternatives will influence the outcome, but so will 
the dynamics of the groups doing the collaborating. Some groups find 
Wikis baffling; others take naturally to them. There isn't (yet) a 
single compelling strategy for next-generation group messaging on the 
Internet. But there are options that make group messaging -- for some 
groups, for specific purposes -- a more productive and useful exercise.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">111</font></p>

<h3>3 Broadcasting and Monitoring News</h3>

<a name="112">
</a><p><a name="112">
The e-print archive at www.arxiv.org has dramatically changed the way 
physicists publicize, and track, the literature in their fields of 
interest. Other scientific communities regard the archive as a bold 
experiment that will likely influence their own practices. Meanwhile, as
 the archive continues to grow in a linear fashion, physicists are 
starting to face some of the same information-overload problems that 
characterize the Web in general. On a recent Tuesday, there were 36 new 
papers in just one of the physics archive's 12 divisions, astrophysics. 
Can astrophysicists read 36 papers a day? Should they try? Clearly not. A
 user of the physics archive will scan the list, prioritize it based on 
interest in topic and familiarity with authors, read selectively, and 
perhaps transmit items of interest to colleagues.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">112</font></p>

<a name="113">
</a><p><a name="113">
Every web user engages daily in this process of information refinement. 
Many share their results -- that is, URLs with annotations -- in the 
form of FYI ("For Your Information") emails. Some also share their 
results on personal "links" pages. And a few employ a new tactic called <i>weblogging</i>.
 A weblog is really just another kind of annotated links page, typically
 in the form of a daily Web diary that filters and reacts to Web 
information flow according to personal and/or professional interests.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">113</font></p>

<a name="114">
</a><p><a name="114">
The current weblog craze is, in all likelihood, a passing fad. If you visit </a><a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>
 (http://www.blogger.com), a portal site that aggregates over 1000 
weblogs, you may conclude that this form of communication has already 
suffered the same fate that befell the Usenet. One "blogger" (short for 
"weblogger") recently complained:
 <font color="green" size="-2">114</font></p>

<blockquote><i>
There was once a hope that the weblog could become a powerful tool
for reaching out and connecting with the world. Instead, it has
become a powerful tool for self-gratification and self-absorption. 
</i></blockquote>

<a name="115">
</a><p><a name="115">
But underlying the weblogging movement are two technological trends -- 
RSS headline syndication, and pushbutton Web publishing -- that lay the 
groundwork for better ways to publicize, and monitor, the activities of 
professional groups.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">115</font></p>

<h4>3.1 RSS headline syndication</h4>
<a name="116">
</a><p><a name="116">
RSS (Rich Site Summary) is an XML vocabulary for representing annotated 
links. It debuted in 1999 as the underpinning of my.netscape.com, a 
service that aggregates news "channels" that are "broadcast" by its 
users. Earlier, in 1995, the PointCast Network (now discontinued) had 
pioneered this idea. But publishing a PointCast channel was a complex 
process. As a result its news network was exploited mainly by existing 
publishing organizations, and ultimately failed. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">116</font></p>
<a name="117">
</a><p><a name="117">
My Netscape made the process radically simpler. Anyone could publish a 
channel by posting a simple XML file to a Web server, and registering 
that file with the service. Users of the service can then personalize 
their My Netscape start pages by selecting from the available channels. 
Here's what that start page can look like:

The center column displays channels from major news publishers. The left
 and right columns display boutique channels run by smaller publishers, 
project teams, and even  individuals. In this example, these channels 
reflect my own interests -- software and networking. There are as yet 
few channels devoted to scientific themes, but such channels easily can,
 certainly should, and probably will emerge.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">119</font></p>

<a name="120">
</a><p><a name="120">
If RSS channels could appear only on My Netscape, the mechanism would be
 of limited value. But there's more to the story. RSS has caught on as a
 standard. Many sites syndicate RSS content, by sourcing channels in XML
 format and rendering them as HTML. And there are several sites -- 
besides My Netscape -- that aggregate RSS feeds, notably UserLand 
Software's </a><a href="http://my.userland.com/">My UserLand</a> (http://my.userland.com) and O'Reilly and Associates' <a href="http://meerkat.oreillynet.com/">Meerkat</a> (http://meerkat.oreillynet.com).
 <font color="green" size="-2">120</font></p>

<a name="121">
</a><p><a name="121">
UserLand's principal, Dave Winer, wears two hats. As a journalist, he 
has for years published technology news in the form of an email 
newsletter and a related website, </a><a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>
 (http://www.scripting.com). In 1997, Winer began offering Scripting 
News in an XML format suitable for syndication. The idea was that, given
 a regular and predictable format for headlines and blurbs, other sites 
wanting to carry a Scripting News feed could easily syndicate the 
content -- that is, scoop up the XML, and retransmit it as HTML tailored
 to their own presentation styles. 
 <font color="green" size="-2">121</font></p>

<a name="122">
</a><p><a name="122">
As a software developer, Winer has evolved his product -- called 
Frontier -- from a Macintosh scripting language into a cross-platform 
(Windows/Mac-based) Internet publishing and content-management system 
known as Manila. It is, among other things, a channel-authoring tool. 
Manila can automatically make the content that it manages available in 
RSS format for syndication. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">122</font></p>

<a name="123">
</a><p><a name="123">
The O'Reilly Network's Meerkat is an "open wire service" that 
demonstrates the emergent properties of RSS syndication. Meerkat watches
 channels listed in two RSS registries -- one at UserLand, one at </a><a href="http://xmltree.com/">xmlTree</a>
 (http://www.xmltree.com). On the union of these two registries (which 
are partly overlapping, partly distinct), Meerkat performs a selection. 
It chooses just those "technology/computer/geek" channels relevant to 
the O'Reilly Network's audience. Then it categorizes these channels so 
that a Meerkat user can make a single selection -- say, Python -- in 
order to view headlines and blurbs from a half-dozen Python-related 
channels.
 <font color="green" size="-2">123</font></p>

<a name="124">
</a><p><a name="124">
Behind the scenes, the editors and writers at the O'Reilly Network -- 
which is itself an informational site for software developers and 
Internet technologists -- use Meerkat to track their individual beats. 
They select interesting items, add additional analysis to them, and 
republish them along with the site's original content. In parallel, they
 maintain Manila weblogs where, as columnists, they can deliver less 
formal, and more personal, summary and analysis. These weblogs, thanks 
to Manila's automatic syndication, flow back out onto the RSS wire. See,
 for example, </a><a href="http://weblogs.oreillynet.com/edd/">Edd Dumbill's weblog</a> (http://weblogs.oreillynet.com/edd/).
 <font color="green" size="-2">124</font></p>

<a name="125">
</a><p><a name="125">
All this adds up to a new kind of information ecology inhabited by RSS 
authors, sites that syndicate RSS content, and services that aggregate, 
select, refine, and republish RSS content. In the most populous niche of
 this ecology -- the "technology/computer/geek" space occupied by the 
likes of UserLand and Meerkat -- the publication and assimilation of 
news is radically simplified and accelerated. News, in this realm, takes
 on a broader-than-usual meaning. Anything that can be referenced with a
 URL is fair game. That includes announcements, feature stories, 
opinions, and analysis published on conventional media sites. But it can
 equally include entries from weblogs that report on very narrow and 
specific fields of interest. Typically, such weblogs are themselves 
aggregators of many sources of information. One of the most intriguing 
new roles that has emerged is what might be called a <i>list guide</i>. 
By that I mean a specialist in a field who monitors its mailing list or 
newsgroup, and draws attention to significant items -- often packaged 
with a bit of analysis. In this way interested people who lack the time 
and/or expertise to process the raw feeds can, nevertheless, keep in 
touch with developments in related, or even distant, disciplines.

<h4>3.2 Pushbutton web publishing</h4>

<a name="126">
</a><p><a name="126">
Although HTML is a far simpler markup language than, say, TeX, today's 
Web is biased heavily toward consuming content, and offers little 
support for producing it. The Web, in its current incarnation, is a 
library in which we read, not a bulletin board on which we scribble. The
 Internet application that we do use for scribbling -- endlessly, 
prolifically -- is email. But while email can (and often does) become 
Web content, it's never first-class Web content. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">126</font></p>

<a name="127">
</a><p><a name="127">
Lately there is movement on a number of fronts to reclaim the two-way, 
read/write architecture that was the Web's original conception. Part of 
the story is a new protocol called WebDAV (Web-based Distributed 
Authoring and Versioning, </a><a href="http://www.webdav.org/">http://www.webdav.org/</a>,
 also known simply as DAV), which enables client applications to store 
documents directly on a DAV-aware Web server, lock and unlock the 
documents, and query or set their properties. DAV-aware servers include 
Apache (with the <a href="http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/">mod_dav module</a>),
 Microsoft's Internet Information Server version 5, and Digital 
Creations' Zope. DAV-aware clients include the Microsoft Office apps 
and, more recently, Adobe's <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/golive">Go Live</a>, a Web authoring and content-management tool.
 <font color="green" size="-2">127</font></p>

<h5>3.2.1 From FTP to WebDAV</h5>

<a name="128">
</a><p><a name="128">
You can think of WebDAV, in its current form, as a "better FTP" that 
integrates directly into applications,  making "save to the Web" a 
pushbutton affair. It supports locking, and deals more powerfully than 
FTP with moving and copying collections of files. The DAV FAQ notes 
these additional benefits:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">128</font></p>

<blockquote><i>
Since DAV works over HTTP, you get all the benefits of HTTP that FTP 
cannot provide. For example: strong authentication, encryption, proxy 
support, and caching. It is true that you can get some of this through 
SSH, but the HTTP infrastructure is  much more widely deployed than SSH.
 Further, SSH does not have the wide complement of tools, development 
libraries, and applications that HTTP does. 
</i></blockquote>

<a name="129">
</a><p><a name="129">
FTP is deeply entrenched and still overwhelmingly dominant, but DAV is 
maturing and will very likely displace FTP over time. Less clear, at 
this moment, is what will come of the </a><a href="http://www.webdav.org/other/faq.html#Q6">versioning and configuration management features</a> (http://www.webdav.org/deltav/goals/draft-ietf-webdav-version-goals-01.txt) proposed for DAV. 
 <font color="green" size="-2">129</font></p>

<h5>3.2.2 Manila</h5>

<a name="130">
</a><p><a name="130">
Manila's approach to the two-way Web proceeds from the assumption that, 
while DAV-enabled writing and content-management tools are desirable, 
they are not strictly necessary. The basic browser, backed by 
conventional Web-server software, can empower groups to collaborate and 
to publish their collaborations on the Web. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">130</font></p>

<a name="131">
</a><p><a name="131">
To that end Manila, among other things, is a Web-based discussion 
system. Every story or news item posted to a Manila site can be a 
launching point for threaded discussion -- which can occur out in the 
open, visible to all site visitors, or privately, visible only to 
members of the site. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">131</font></p>

<a name="132">
</a><p><a name="132">
Manila supports pushbutton web publishing in a number of ways:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">132</font></p>

<ul>

<li>
<a name="133">
</a><p><a name="133">
<b>Instant startup.</b>
UserLand offers a free service -- </a><a href="http://www.editthispage.com/">www.EditThisPage.com</a>
 -- so that anyone can launch and run a collaborative weblog that 
publishes news and discussion in some area of interest, and integrates 
with the RSS news network. You can, of course, buy Manila/Frontier and 
deploy it on your own Internet or intranet site, but EditThisPage.com 
delivers instant gratification.
 <font color="green" size="-2">133</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="134">
</a><p><a name="134">
<b>Live editing.</b>
A site operator can use the Edit link that appears on every page to 
fetch and modify the page in a browser form. There's limited support for
 Wiki-like automatic formatting and, in MSIE, a simple interactive 
formatter helps authors apply styles to selected ranges of text. In 
general, though, Manila doesn't pretend to be a full-blown Web authoring
 environment. Its goal is to move the kind of simple writing that we do 
in email into the realm of managed, and syndicated, websites.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">134</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="135">
</a><p><a name="135">
<b>Publication workflow.</b>
A Manila site embodies a specific groupware protocol -- that of a 
newspaper or journal. It supports the notion of a managing editor, 
working with a team of contributing editors, to produce a stream of 
stories that are developed internally, discussed, edited, and then 
released to the public. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">135</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="136">
</a><p><a name="136">
<b>Spontaneous citation.</b>
One of the most fundamental acts of Internet collaboration is the "FYI 
email" -- a message that cites, or attaches, an interesting Web 
document. It's incredibly valuable to be able to do this spontaneously, 
as email permits. But there are also some severe drawbacks. The FYI 
email targets only the specified recipients. It appears in their message
 flow -- too often, as clutter -- and then scrolls off the event 
horizon. It doesn't, in general, create a public document that can be 
found by other people, at other times, working in different contexts. 
With Manila, the impulse behind a spontaneous FYI email can -- using a 
small helper application called Manila Express -- be expressed as a 
spontaneous act of web publishing. Consider this example:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">136</font></p>

<a name="137">
</a><p><a name="137"><b>Figure 5: Manila Express</b> </a><font color="green" size="-2">137</font></p>
<img src="udell_files/manilaexpress.gif" border="2">

<a name="138">
</a><p><a name="138">
Here, while viewing an astrophysics abstract in MSIE, I've launched 
Manila Express (from MSIE's right-click-accessible popup menu). It has 
loaded the URL of the abstract into its editing window, and I've begun 
to write an annotation for the cited paper. When I click the Post 
button, the URL-plus-annotation is added to my Manila weblog -- <i>and to its RSS channel</i>.
 Thus, in a single stroke, I've accomplished three collaborative goals. 
First, I've alerted anyone who visits my weblog to the existence of this
 paper, and my explanation of its importance. Second, I've enabled the 
paper, and my analysis of it, to form the seed of a threaded discussion.
 Third, I've broadcast my citation-plus-analysis to the RSS network, so 
that people not directly tuned into my weblog can nevertheless discover 
this item. How? Let's turn our attention from the realm of RSS authoring
 and publishing to the realm of RSS aggregation, viewing, and searching.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">138</font></p>
</li>

</ul>

<h5>3.2.3 Meerkat</h5>

<a name="139">
</a><p><a name="139">
Meerkat is nominally an RSS aggregator and viewer. It fetches RSS 
channels from multiple registries, eliminates duplication, and stores 
the resulting set of items in a database. Through its Web interface you 
can query that database. In this example, Meerkat reports all items for 
the last 30 days, from all channels grouped in the SCIENCE category, 
that mention the term "black hole":
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">139</font></p>

<a name="140">
</a><p><a name="140"><b>Figure 6: Meerkat</b> </a><font color="green" size="-2">140</font></p>
<img src="udell_files/meerkat.gif">

<a name="141">
</a><p><a name="141">
But Meerkat's inventor, Rael Dornfest, has also made it into tool that 
simplifies publishing, as well as viewing, sets of RSS items. Registered
 users can define two kinds of named collections. A <i>profile</i> is a stored query. So for example, the Meerkat URL </a><a href="http://meerkat.oreillynet.com/?p=739">http://meerkat.oreillynet.com/?p=739</a> names a query that asks: "Show me all the items from Jon Udell's channel." A <i>mob</i>
 is an arbitrary collection of items. A user can define such a 
collection, give it a name such as "BlackHole," then assign items from 
any channel to it by clicking one of the item's circular icons. Like 
profiles, mobs are represented by URLs that can be shared in email, or 
published on websites.
 <font color="green" size="-2">141</font></p>

<a name="142">
</a><p><a name="142">
For the Meerkat user, managing these stored queries and named 
collections is a point-and-click affair. But suppose you want to 
republish these views of the RSS news flow? Meerkat supports a number of
 interfaces that make it easy to repurpose the content it manages. You 
can, for example, ask Meerkat to produce output in the same RSS format 
that it consumes. In this mode, Meerkat runs as a pure filter -- one of 
potentially many phases in an information-refinement pipeline. This is a
 crucial point. Applications and services that both consume and produce 
XML are, automatically, reusable components that can be combined and 
recombined to create novel effects. There is not likely to be a single 
"killer app" in the realm of Internet groupware. Rather, there will be a
 "killer infrastructure" -- based on universal representation of data in
 XML -- that enables a whole class of specialized, ad-hoc applications 
in the same way that the UNIX pipeline did.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">142</font></p>

<a name="143">
</a><p><a name="143">
Alternatively, to present a Meerkat view on a Web page, you can instead 
ask Meerkat to render the XML into HTML. This XML-to-HTML transformation
 is necessary because not all browsers can render XML directly. But 
we're nearing the end of that era. Internet Explorer can already do it. 
So can the new Mozilla. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">143</font></p>

<h4>3.3 The importance of RSS technology</h4>

<a name="144">
</a><p><a name="144">
RSS is widely regarded as one of the more successful applications of 
XML. One reason, undoubtedly, is that it's a very simple application of 
XML. I've focused here on tools that automate the creation and use of 
RSS channels but, in truth, these tools are optional. Here's an item 
from my own channel:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">144</font></p>

<pre>&lt;item&gt;
&lt;title&gt;
Talk | MathML
&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link&gt;http://www.byte.com/nntp/applications?comment_id=7158#thread&lt;/link&gt;
&lt;description&gt;
There appears to be strong progress on the MathML front. 
The w3c working draft (version 2) is in last call, and it
is one of more beautifully written documents of its type 
that I've ever seen.
&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/item&gt;
</pre>

<a name="145">
</a><p><a name="145">
As with HTML itself, RSS is easily written by hand. That makes it 
equally easy to create tools that transform a variety of other formats 
into RSS. Unlike HTML, RSS content can be parsed in a simple and 
reliable way by any XML-aware scripting language. That makes it easy to 
create tools, like Meerkat, that capture, organize, and enhance RSS 
flows. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">145</font></p>

<a name="146">
</a><p><a name="146">
The value of the RSS network depends, of course, on the nature and 
quality of news flowing through it. In the "technology/computer/geek" 
community where RSS evolved, it has become a powerful, well-established,
 and comprehensive system for focusing attention on leading-edge 
developments. Tools like Manila and Meerkat are rapidly evolving in ways
 that can bring the benefits of that system to other communities in need
 of them, including many scientific communities. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">146</font></p>

<a name="147">
</a><p><a name="147">
Information overload is a severe problem, and there isn't a single best 
solution. Weblogs syndicated on the RSS network are no more inherently 
immune to signal degradation than the Usenet was. XML, in and of itself,
 doesn't change anything either. What is new, and hopeful, is the notion
 of a standard format for content syndication. That standard is enabling
 a new class of information-refinement tools. These tools in turn enable
 people to search, select, annotate, and reorganize the Web's chaotic 
flow more easily and more effectively than is otherwise possible.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">147</font></p>

<h3>4 Scientific Publishing</h3>

<a name="148">
</a><p><a name="148">
For scientific publishing, there isn't yet an acceptable alternative to 
TeX/LaTeX, Word, and FrameMaker. But better solutions are in view, and 
they all revolve around standard representation of content in XML. 
Admittedly, while the publishing industry has embraced XML in principle 
as the universal format for content, there is not yet in practice much 
writing of XML. When </a><a href="http://www.webreview.com/">Web Review</a> (http://www.webreview.com/) <a href="http://webreview.com/wr/pub/2000/06/23/poll/results.html">asked its audience</a>
 of Web-savvy authors and developers how many were writing XML, more 
than half responded "Don't know where to begin," and only 15% said "Use 
regularly" (http://webreview.com/wr/pub/2000/06/23/poll/results.html). 
 <font color="green" size="-2">148</font></p>

<a name="149">
</a><p><a name="149">
Few could argue against the inherent benefits of an XML-aware writing 
tool. Consider, for example, why TeX is popular. Math typesetting is 
part of the reason, but TeX's ability to transform bibliographic markup 
into the various formats required by journals is another key strength.

</ul>

<a name="155">
</a><p><a name="155">
MS Word doesn't do these things yet, but Microsoft's June 2000 </a><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/topics/f2k/presskit.asp">announcement of its XML-based ".NET platorm"</a>
 (http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/topics/f2k/presskit.asp) suggests 
that Word inevitably will. Meanwhile, other vendors are charging ahead. 
In 1999, <a href="http://www.softquad.com/">SoftQuad</a> 
(http://www.softquad.com/) broke new ground with the first affordable 
WYSIWYG XML editor, XMetaL. Previously, the market for such tools was 
dominated by multi-thousand-dollar SGML tools, retrofitted with XML 
capability, from companies such as <a href="http://www.arbortext.com/">ArborText</a> (http://www.arbortext.com) and <a href="http://www.inso.com/">Inso</a> (http://www.inso.com). XMetaL, a $500 Window desktop application, delivers many of the benefits of the high-end tools.
 <font color="green" size="-2">155</font></p>

<a name="156">
</a><p><a name="156">
In XMetaL's WYSIWYG mode, you write as with any word processor. Display 
of the XML content is controlled by a CSS stylesheet. Everything you 
write in XMetaL is also validated -- interactively -- against a DTD 
(document type definition). Given a DTD that describes the elements that
 can occur in a scientific paper, and the sequence and patterns in which
 these elements can occur, XMetaL helps you to create a conforming 
document, prompting with the elements that are valid in a given context,
 much as a programmer's editor might prompt for the arguments that it is
 legal to pass to a function. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">156</font></p>

<a name="157">
</a><p><a name="157">
Like the new generation of browsers (MSIE 5, Mozilla), XMetaL is also a 
toolkit for developing content-oriented applications. It provides a W3C 
Document Object Model (DOM) interface to the content that it manages, 
and it wraps a universal scripting interface around that DOM. Because 
XMetaL is an ActiveX scripting host, scripts can be written in any 
compliant scripting language including VBScript, JavaScript, Perl, or 
Python. Such scripts can be used, among other things, to create 
"wizards" that help users write to DTD-prescribed formats. And this is 
the crucial point. A DTD that defines bibliographies for scientific 
papers is, by itself, just a passive set of rules to be learned and 
followed. People won't embrace XML-oriented writing tools if they're 
expected to replace one set of passive rules for another. What people 
will embrace are tools that help them enact required protocols. 
Bibliographic citation is just one example of such a protocol. 
Understood properly, virtually every act of written communication -- a 
software bug report, a comment on a draft of a paper, an email message 
requesting action on a certain item by a certain date -- is located, 
conceptually, within a rule-based protocol.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">157</font></p>

<a name="158">
</a><p><a name="158">
The future of Internet-based collaboration depends, to a very great 
extent, on the ability of software to embody these protocols. In this 
regard, XML's role as a universal storage and exchange format is only 
half of the story. Equally vital is its ability to express, and enforce,
 the rules of engagement that govern all collaboration. It can't meet 
that objective, though, until it's woven into the fabric of everyday 
life. Structured writing can't, and won't, continue to be a specialized 
activity. It needs to flow automatically from normal use of the 
frontline applications -- word processors, email clients -- that capture
 most of what we say, and produce most of what we know.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">158</font></p>

<a name="159">
</a><p><a name="159">
The bad news is that infrastructure change on this order of magnitude 
can't happen quickly. The good news, though, is that there is now 
general consensus as to how to accomplish the change, and much 
demonstrable recent progress. To illustrate that concretely, let's 
consider how two datatypes central to scientific collaboration -- 
equations and charts -- are being woven into the fabric of the emerging 
two-way Web.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">159</font></p>

<h4>4.1 Math on the Web</h4>

<a name="160">
</a><p><a name="160">
For scientists it's painfully ironic that the Web, invented expressly to
 help them collaborate, still lacks strong support for one of the 
primary forms of scientific discourse: mathematical equations. As a 
result, mathematical content is typically delivered on the Web in one of
 a number of unsatisfactory ways. Equations can be viewed as bitmapped 
images included within HTML files, or within PDF files, or in a Java 
viewer (e.g., </a><a href="http://www.webeq.com/">WebEQ</a>), or in a free or commercial plug-in (e.g., <a href="http://www.livemath.com/">LiveMath</a>, <a href="http://www.software.ibm.com/techexplorer">IBM techExplorer</a>).
 In all of these cases, however, equations end up as foreign data types.
 Things you can't do with this foreign content include:

For years there's been discussion of a more Web-native way to create and
 display math. These efforts are now beginning to bear fruit. A second 
version of the W3C's working draft of </a><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-MathML2-20000328/">MathML</a>
 (http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-MathML2-20000328/), a math-oriented 
application of XML, is in the "last call" stage, and both commercial 
vendors and the open source community are lining up in support of it.
 <font color="green" size="-2">167</font></p>

<a name="168">
</a><p><a name="168">
Why the slow start? Pre-existing tools, notably Donald Knuth's TeX -- a 
superlative and widely-used system for math typesetting and composition 
-- weren't easy to integrate with the Web's original model. Only 
recently has XML become firmly established as a general strategy for 
extending the Web. It's one thing to embed a foreign chunk of math into 
an HTML page, like this:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">168</font></p>

<a name="169">
</a><p><a name="169">
<b>Figure 7: Foreign math</b>
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">169</font></p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#ccffcc"><tbody><tr><td>
<pre>&lt;p&gt;
As you can see from this example:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;embed src="SomeMathPlugin"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
, the result...
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<a name="170">
</a><p><a name="170">
It's something else again to weave the math right into the fabric of the page, like this:

<a name="171">
</a><p><a name="171">
<b>Figure 8: Native math</b>
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">171</font></p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#ccffcc"><tbody><tr><td>
<pre>&lt;p&gt;
As you can see from this example:
&lt;math&gt;
  &lt;mfrac <b>style="font-size: 14pt"</b>&gt;
    &lt;msqrt&gt;
      &lt;mi <b>href="/definitions#k" xml:link="simple"</b>&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;

Note the <tt>style</tt> attribute attached to the <tt>&lt;mfrac&gt;</tt> element. Note also how the term <i>k</i> links to an address (<tt>/definitions#k</tt>), so that the reader of this equation can click on the <i>k</i>
 to find out more about it. This is the kind of deep and fluid 
integration that the phrase "math for the Web" conjures in our 
imaginations. And it's now tantalizingly close to being real. I didn't 
just pull the markup in Figure 8 out of thin air. I captured it from the
 View Source window of </a><a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya">Amaya</a> (http://www.w3.org/Amaya), the W3C's testbed browser. Here's Amaya displaying the equation in Figure 8:

</a><p><a name="173"><b>Figure 9: Amaya rendering MathML</b> </a><font color="green" size="-2">173</font></p>
<img src="udell_files/amaya.gif">

<a name="174">
</a><p><a name="174">
Clearly Amaya is rendering the font style attribute attached to the 
fraction. But a couple of things aren't obvious in this screen shot. 
First, the hyperlink wrapped around the <i>k</i> really is there, and 
really works. Second, Amaya isn't just a viewer, it's an editor. 
Everything that it's displaying -- the text and the equation -- is also 
live for editing.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">174</font></p>

<a name="175">
</a><p><a name="175">
In the case of Amaya, such editing occurs in WYSIWYG mode. But an 
effective tool might as easily accept TeX markup, such as many 
scientists are trained to write. The point is not <i>how</i> the web version of a document is edited, but <i>that it can be edited</i> in a direct way.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">175</font></p>

<a name="176">
</a><p><a name="176">
Currently at version 3.2, Amaya isn't nearly stable enough or complete 
enough for real work, but it's an intoxicating glimpse of the way things
 ought to be. In addition to MathML, incidentally, its XHTML 
capabilities are noteworthy. You can use its "Save as XHTML" feature to 
automate the grunge work of transforming a file of normal HTML into a 
file of well-formed and more maintainable XHTML.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">176</font></p>

<h5>4.1.1 Beyond compound documents</h5>

<a name="177">
</a><p><a name="177">
Since the advent of OLE and OpenDoc, we've aspired to "document-centric"
 computing. We no longer want GUI windows to represent monolithic 
documents backed by single applications. Rather, we want them to contain
 heterogenous documents that represent task-focused activities and that 
are supported by a suite of cooperating applications. While technologies
 like OLE embedding enabled a window to contain a mixture of textual, 
graphical, and tabular components, each of these was still backed by an 
application that represented the data in its own proprietary way. You 
could mix the components on the page, and pass data among them using DDE
 or the clipboard, but you couldn't really blend them together. The 
model was more like Figure 7 than like Figure 8.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">177</font></p>

<a name="178">
</a><p><a name="178">
What justifies all the XML hype is that it promises to fundamentally 
unify the representation of data. When a page contains a chunk of XHTML 
text, and a chunk of MathML equations, and a chunk of SVG graphics, it 
isn't just a canvas with three things stuck onto it. It's a fabric woven
 from three kinds of threads. Textual elements belonging to each thread 
are subject to the same search and styling mechanisms. Every element is 
part of the DOM (document object model) and, as such, available to 
controlling scripts. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">178</font></p>

<a name="179">
</a><p><a name="179">
To understand why universal data representation matters so much, ask 
yourself: "Why did UNIX succeed?" The stock answer is that UNIX invented
 the idea of software components that could easily be arranged in many 
useful ways. But what made that possible? The components agreed on way 
of representing data as line-oriented text made of tokens delimited by 
whitespace. That enabled a host of glue technologies -- the shells, sed,
 awk, Perl. We're now seeing a new generation of glue technologies that 
agree on the much richer data representation afforded by XML. For 
interconnecting Web services, these XML-over-HTTP protocols have rapidly
 become the de facto standard. The next frontier will be Web 
applications that move beyond Figure 7's compound document model, and 
agree on standard XML data representation that allows different 
datatypes to blend and interact.

<h5>4.1.2 Mozilla and MathML</h5>

<a name="180">
</a><p><a name="180">
The Mozilla project is taking MathML very seriously. The MathML support 
isn't in the standard build yet, but if you want to try it you can 
download a </a><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/">MathML-enabled version of Mozilla</a>
 (http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/). Unlike 
Amaya, Mozilla isn't (yet) a MathML editor, only a viewer, but as such 
it's making terrific progress. Interestingly, as noted in a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/update.html">progress report</a>
 (http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/update.html) by Roger Sidje, a 
key (and non-Netscape-employed) contributor, MathML is the first major 
Mozilla component driven entirely by outside interests unaligned with 
Netscape's commercial priorities.
 <font color="green" size="-2">180</font></p>

<a name="181">
</a><p><a name="181">
The initial goal of the Mozilla MathML effort is to leverage -- and 
stress-test -- the browser's new layout engine ("Gecko"). To that end, 
it will focus on <i>presentation markup</i> as opposed to <i>content markup</i>.
 What's the difference? The former says things like "put a row of 
elements here, then underneath, a box containing these elements."  The 
latter says things like "apply this operation to these subexpressions." 
The W3C's working draft explains:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">181</font></p>

<blockquote><i>
<a name="182">
</a><p><a name="182">
Both content and presentation tags are necessary in order to provide
the full expressive capability one would expect in a mathematical markup
language. Often the same mathematical notation is used to represent
several completely different concepts. For example, the notation xi may
be intended (in polynomial algebra) as the i-th power of the variable x,
or as the i-th component of a vector x (in tensor calculus). In other
cases, the same mathematical concept may be displayed in one of various
notations. For instance, the factorial of a number might be expressed
with an exclamation mark, a Gamma function, or a Pochhammer symbol.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">182</font></p>
<a name="183">
</a><p><a name="183">
Thus the same notation may represent several mathematical ideas, and,
conversely, the same mathematical idea often has several notations. In
order to provide authors with the ability to precisely control notation
while at the same time encoding meanings in a machine-readable way, both
content and presentation markup are needed.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">183</font></p>
</i></blockquote>

<a name="184">
</a><p><a name="184">
There are deep subtleties here. Sometimes presentation markup embeds 
within content markup so that the application gets hints about how to 
render equations; sometimes content markup embeds within presentation 
markup, to specify which mathematical meaning is intended; sometimes the
 two occur in parallel, when the relationship between content and 
presentation cannot easily be inferred. Even for specialized math 
software, mastering these subtleties will take a long time. So how can 
Mozilla compete? It doesn't have to. The purpose of its MathML support 
is to help people communicate mathematically on the Web, in accordance 
with this excellent mission statement from the W3C:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">184</font></p>

<blockquote><i>
<a name="185">
</a><p><a name="185">
In practical terms, the observation that mathematics on the Web should 
provide for both specialized and general needs naturally leads to the 
idea of a layered architecture. One layer consists of powerful, general 
software tools exchanging, processing and rendering suitably encoded 
mathematical data. A second layer consists of specialized software 
tools, aimed at specific user groups, which are capable of easily 
generating encoded mathematical data which can then be shared with a 
particular audience.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">185</font></p>
<a name="186">
</a><p><a name="186">
MathML is designed to provide the encoding of mathematical information 
for the bottom, more general layer in a two-layer architecture. It is 
intended to encode complex notational and semantic structure in an 
explicit, regular, and easy-to-process way for renderers, searching and 
indexing software, and other mathematical applications.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">186</font></p>
</i></blockquote>

<a name="187">
</a><p><a name="187">
In light of this goal, consider </a><a href="http://jonudell.net/mathmail.gif">this screenshot</a> posted to <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.mathml">news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.mathml</a>, which illustrates the composition of an email message that intermixes textual and mathematical content:

</a><p><a name="189">
Now <i>that's</i> a picture of the way things ought to be! And not just 
for math on the Web, but for all kinds of content. Scientific 
collaboration is an ongoing discourse involving text, graphics, math, 
and other datatypes. Why shouldn't email, the medium through which so 
much of that discourse is conducted, natively understand those 
datatypes? Clearly it should. This inspiring glimpse of the future 
reminds us that the days of the 65-character-per-line ASCII-art email 
message are, inevitably, numbered.

<h4>4.2 SVG: PostScript for the Web</h4>

<a name="190">
</a><p><a name="190">
When scientific papers written in TeX include charts and illustrations, 
these are embedded as foreign (typically, PostScript) objects in the TeX
 source stream. Once rendered to PDF, as is now done on demand for 
papers posted to the physics e-print archive at www.arxiv.org, the text,
 equations, and illustrations appear to merge into a single 
presentation. But PDF files are not first-class citizens in the Web 
environment. Like PostScript objects embedded in TeX files, PDF files 
are themselves foreign objects that do not integrate natively with the 
"universal canvas" of the web. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">190</font></p>

<a name="191">
</a><p><a name="191">
Microsoft coined the term "universal canvas" when it announced its 
next-generation platform, .NET. The term connotes a single viewing and 
editing surface on which heterogenous datatypes fluidly interact. These 
datatypes are supported by a range of specialized services for text, 
equations, and illustrations. But, since everything shares a common XML 
representation, there are also common services for search and 
annotation. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">191</font></p>

<a name="192">
</a><p><a name="192">
Consider this simple bar chart:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">192</font></p>


<a name="193">
</a><p><a name="193"><b>Figure 11: Simple chart</b> </a><font color="green" size="-2">193</font></p>
<img src="udell_files/chart.gif" border="2">

<a name="194">
</a><p><a name="194">
To include this chart in a printed report, you need to rasterize the 
image. The same rasterized image can be embedded in an online, 
HTML-based version of the report, but:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">194</font></p>

<ul>

<li>
<a name="195">
</a><p><a name="195">
You can't search or select the text in the chart in the same way that 
you search or select the text of the report that embeds the chart.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">195</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="196">
</a><p><a name="196">
You can't redraw the chart to show more (or less) detail. That's not an 
issue in this simple case, but for complex illustrations you'd like to 
have use of the information in a scalable vector format, not a 
rasterized (bitmapped) format.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">196</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="197">
</a><p><a name="197">
You can't link from elements of the chart so that, for example, each of 
its datapoints leads to a page of supporting details, or to an input 
mechanism that collects annotations specific to that element.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">197</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="198">
</a><p><a name="198">
You can't link <i>to</i> elements of the chart. In a more complex 
illustration, there might be several views. Ideally these should be 
named, and the illustration should export that namespace so that its 
component views can be referenced directly.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">198</font></p>
</li>


</ul>

<a name="199">
</a><p><a name="199">
A PDF version of the chart, included in an online version of the report,
 delivers some of these capabilities. It's scalable, and can support 
outbound linking. But it can't support direct inbound references, and if
 its container is HTML it won't integrate very well with that container.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">199</font></p>

<a name="200">

Clearly HTML's primitive vector graphics can't support even pie charts, 
let alone plots of equations. But consensus is now emerging that SVG (</a><a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">Scalable Vector Graphics, http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/)</a>
 is ready to deliver more sophisticated vector graphics in a way that 
preserves the benefits of HTML's Web-native approach. Adobe has now 
released the 1.0 version of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/"> SVG viewer</a>. Here's a picture of an SVG version of the same chart, viewed in MSIE with the Adobe SVG plug-in.

Creating the SVG version of the chart is a lot like creating the HTML 
version -- and that's a very good thing. As with HTML, there are all 
sorts of construction techniques: you can write the stuff by hand in a 
text editor, you can write scripts to automate parts of that process, or
 you can use WYSIWYG editors to build it interactively. Web developers 
already familiar with CSS styling and scripted, template-driven HTML 
construction will find themselves immediately productive with SVG.

A chunk of SVG like the one in Figure 13, whether tool-written or 
hand-written, wants to be parameterized so you can automatically repeat 
it with variations. That's a job for a script. The familiar idiom used 
so often to automate HTML construction -- templatize a chunk of markup, 
then loop through a data structure populating instances of the template 
-- works equally well in SVG.

In the short run, PDFs made from TeX files with embedded PostScript 
illustrations will continue to be widely used, and to be useful. The 
same is true for HTML documents that embed rasterized illustrations. But
 SVG (or something very like it) will prevail, because in the long run 
the benefits of the universal canvas are irresistable. An SVG 
illustration isn't just something stuck onto a Web page, it's woven 
right into the fabric of the page. You can search for text anywhere. You
 can link from SVG elements to other content. Or you can link <i>to</i> 
SVG elements from elsewhere. Like an HTML page with many named regions, a
 chunk of SVG can export a namespace that defines entry points to 
multiple views.

In a </a><a href="http://www.excosoft.se/indexns.html">thought-provoking essay</a> (http://www.excosoft.se/indexns.html), Jan Christian Herlitz, R&amp;D manager for <a href="http://www.excosoft.se/">ExcoSoft</a>, notes that a spreadsheet can be represented in XML like this:

Does this mean that Excel is an XML editor because it stores data in 
XML? Will today's XML editors be spreadsheet tools if they can read 
Excel files? The answer to both questions is an emphatic no! A 
spreadsheet editor must map the XML code onto a spreadsheet data 
structure with cells and formulas, calculate results, and present the 
results in the typical spreadsheet manner.

The next generation of editors will read and present XML-based 
information, whether it be paragraphs, tables, drawings, e-mails or 
spreadsheets. Everything will be done in one user interface. Behind the 
scene, different software components from different vendors will be 
activated to handle different parts of the information. Integration will
 be achieved through "styling". An element will be styled as, for 
example, a spreadsheet. A spreadsheet component will be fetched to 
calculate and present the information. As everything is basically XML, 
the user will experience a much simpler and more natural user interface.
 All types of information can be stored in one document (separate 
entities are not needed). Text is handled in a uniform manner. 
Everything can be searched. Everything can be styled. Everything can be 
inside everything else; an equation inside a table which is inside a 
drawing which is inside a spreadsheet.

The next generation of editors will be both editors and browsers, but 
they will not in a meaningful sense be XML editors. They will simply be 
clients!

Everything's converging on universal data representation in XML. We're 
headed beyond OLE-style embedding, into a realm where datatypes blend 
more intimately and where standard tools and techniques apply to 
heterogenous mixtures of these datatypes. SVG isn't ready for prime time
 yet, but it's designed to support Web-based collaboration in ways that 
PDF is not.

<h3>5 Final Recommendations</h3>

<a name="218">
</a><p><a name="218">
The "universal canvas" is a lovely idea that we will, let's hope, 
someday take for granted. But we live in the present. Although we like 
to think we're running on "Internet time" the tools available for 
collaboration change slowly, as does the culture surrounding the use of 
those tools.

Email always was, and still legitimately remains, the fundamental tool 
of Internet collaboration. But there is now emerging a class of 
Web-based services that can augment or replace email for certain kinds 
of collaboration, such as event scheduling (e.g., TimeDance) or 
discussion (e.g. QuickTopic). These services are notable both because 
they meet immediate practical needs, and because -- being Web-based 
services -- they can act as the building blocks of new, ad-hoc 
collaborative solutions. They are to the Web what <tt>grep</tt> and friends are to UNIX -- reusable components that can be pipelined.

<a name="220">
</a><p><a name="220">
The Web version of this report ([Final URL]) illustrates one such 
pipelined solution. The document's source is XML in its simplest form --
 that is, HTML that observes a few conventions required for XML 
compliance. As such it is easily transformed into an enhanced rendering 
that is "instrumented" for collaboration. Here's a picture of that 
enhanced rendering:

<a name="222">
</a><p><a name="222">
The numbered links following each paragraph mean that each location in 
the document can be referred to precisely. And the actions tied to those
 links support collaborative review of the document. Clicking on one of 
the links in Figure 15 produces this form:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">222</font></p>

<a name="223">
</a><p><a name="223"><b>Figure 16: Form for commenting on this report</b> </a><font color="green" size="-2">223</font></p>
<img src="udell_files/postComment.gif">

<a name="224">
</a><p><a name="224">
The form in turn posts a comment to a QuickTopic discussion space:
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">224</font></p>

<a name="225">
</a><p><a name="225"><b>Figure 17: Discussion space for this report</b> </a><font color="green" size="-2">225</font></p>
<img src="udell_files/tioFeedback.gif">

<a name="226">
</a><p><a name="226">
In that discussion space, a comment refers back to the document, at the location in the document that triggered the comment.

<a name="227">
</a><p><a name="227">
Exactly how this works isn't important here. The salient points are:

<ul>
<li>
<a name="228">
</a><p><a name="228">
<b>It wasn't hard to arrange this effect.</b>
Well-structured content, even of the simplest kind, has emergent 
properties. It easily and naturally morphs into forms that support 
Web-based collaboration.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">228</font></p>
</li>

<li>
<a name="229">
</a><p><a name="229">
<b>Any Web discussion component could support the effect.</b>
Although I've used QuickTopic here, I could as easily have used any 
discussion tool that can plug into what we might call a "Web pipeline." 
Most Web services have this property automatically, just because they <i>are</i> Web services, equally accessible to interactive browsers and to programmatic scripts.

<b>The lack of XML writing tools is a critical bottleneck.</b>
The writing tools we use every day -- word processors, email composers 
-- capture most of the raw materials of Internet collaboration. But they
 don't capture the stuff, yet, as XML. It's true that for a scientist 
who has mastered TeX or LaTeX, the marked-up source of this report is 
child's play. But nobody ought to be expected to compose markup 
directly. Scientists should expect, and demand, that their everyday 
writing and messaging tools process text, equations, and illustrations 
in a WYSIWYG manner, and represent the stuff in a universal standard 
format that enables new, more granular, more accessible, and more 
powerful forms of collaboration.

<b>Web services can already support better collaboration.</b>
The XML-aware writing tools we need are coming along too slowly. But 
much can be accomplished without them. The discussion space for this 
report would still be extremely useful even without the XML-enabled 
element-level crosslinking. There are lots of opportunities, nowadays, 
to move collaboration into shared spaces. Doing so can help relieve some
 of the problems we create for one another when we force email to carry 
the whole burden.

<h4>5.1 The two-way Web</h4>

<a name="232">
</a><p><a name="232">
The goal of Internet groupware should be to reclaim the original vision 
of the Web as a medium of collaboration. It's no accident that vision 
arose in a scientific milieu since the enterprise of science is so 
deeply rooted in collaboration.
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">232</font></p>

<a name="233">
</a><p><a name="233">
This report ends with two final messages. First, we're closer to the 
two-way Web than we realize. Services such as TimeDance, QuickTopic, 
Manila, and Meerkat are already making it easier than ever to create and
 use shared information spaces. They aren't final solutions, but we 
should use them for all they're worth, and watch for new kinds of 
collaborative services that are emerging every day. Only by using these 
services in their current form will we discover, collectively, what they
 need to evolve into. 
 </a><font color="green" size="-2">233</font></p>

<a name="234">
</a><p><a name="234">
Second, the roadmap to the future is coming more sharply into focus. The
 first-generation Web, though remarkably powerful, is an awkward 
combination of many different protocols and data formats. The emerging 
consensus around XML, as a universal way both to interconnect services 
and to represent many different kinds of information, is the key to a 
next-generation Web that may finally start to deliver on the 
collaborative vision of the original. There's nothing magical about XML.
 It isn't pixie dust. It doesn't, in and of itself, help us collaborate.
 What will help is messages, documents, applications, and services that 
all agree on a standard way of representing data -- one that's richer 
than the line-oriented ASCII we've used so long and so well. That 
standardization is now occurring. We should welcome it, and we should 
demand that our tools respect and embrace it.

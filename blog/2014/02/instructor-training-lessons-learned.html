<!-- start excerpt -->
When I first started Software Carpentry, the main goal was to help some of my colleagues shave some time off their daily work and make better use of a few basic technologies. They were experiencing pain in crunching data in excel, other broad examples that others can relate to and understand> - spending more time manually working with data and content than they were actually doing research. 

As the project has grown over the last few years, I realized that this wasn't a problem specific to just that set of researchers at Los Alamos, but a bottleneck members of the research community were experiencing worldwide, 

Back in June, Software Carpentry joined forces with a new program at Mozilla, the Mozilla Science Lab, and since then we've been thinking long and hard about how we can not only scale our efforts as Software Carpentry, but also join up the dots (conversations, programs and communities) around open science on the web. 

something here about the SWC community and others on the practitioner side, doing this work in the trenches, but not always a part of the other discussions about open data policies, new tools and technologies, or innovations from publishers around open content> 

Digital literacy as an enabler

in broad mozilla speak, explain the current gaps in the system - why SWC is so transformative, but also how we're not aiming to turn every scientist into a coder or teach to certain tools, but rather help shift practice. can point to other articles about digital literacy writ broad and its importance, too>

What "teach the web" means to us

tip a hat to the work Mozilla has done to lower the activation energy as much as possible so that communities can make, create, remix and build on the web. that what we're doing with software carpentry is a parallel effort to that of the teach the web program and webmaker, looking to provide the skills needed to the research community to help them more efficiently work with digital information - be it data, content or a bit of code. highlight the fact that when we say "teach the web", we're not talking necessarily about HTML and CSS - it's the method of working, of providing an intro to the core competencies and skills needed to work in modern research to work in an increasingly digital, data-driven environment.>

something about the characteristics of the web - the interoperability aspect, being able to take components, reuse them freely, build on one's work - draw that parallel to modern research and reproducibility. perhaps something about the web literacy map - or mitchell's framing of the web being ours and interoperable. something about the web characteristics that we sometimes lose sight of in these discussions about "making the web work for science" - and how SWC is helping with a piece of that puzzle>

Linking and building communities

we strongly believe that to build and strengthen the open research community, we need to build capacity, and view educational programs like SWC as a way of reaching researchers in a way that enables as well as offers immediate, pragmatic help to some of their everyday problems. over the course of the next year, we'll be looking at how we can not only provide longer term engagement and learning so that participants have a better chance of adopting these new practices following the 2 day bootcamps, but also to work on making the link and thinking of bootcamp participants as contributors and members of the broader open science community. give them a voice as well as means to learn about the other advances in open research and tools for web-enabled science. join up those dots.>

and work to create inroads with other research groups across disciplines and geographic locations, with SWC as a means of building and enabling communities from the ground up.>

call for folks to join us.?

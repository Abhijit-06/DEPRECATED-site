<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  We recently finished our seventh round of instructor training,
  and will be issuing badges to our graduates
  as soon as they've had a chance to teach a workshop.
  As our <a href="http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/category/round-8-3/">eighth cohort</a>
  heads into their third practical exercise,
  and signups continue to come in for
  the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/software-carpentry-instructor-training-registration-9481333925">live version</a>
  of the course on April 28-30 in Toronto,
  this seems like a good time to reflect on what <em>we've</em> learned from this course.
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<p>
  First, a note on mechanics.
  The course nominally runs 12 weeks,
  but in practice it always stretches to 14 or 15 because of holidays and other delays.
  Trainees do the reading and practical work on their own time,
  posting results on our <a href="http://teaching.software-carpentry.org">shared blog</a>
  and commenting on each other's work.
  We meet as a group for an hour online after each practical
  (which in theory means every two weeks);
  each meeting is held three times (at 10:00, 14:00, and 19:00 Eastern)
  to accommodate different time zones.
</p>
<p>
  The focus of the training is <em>not</em> primarily the Software Carpentry lesson material.
  Instead,
  we try to give participants a crash course in educational psychology and instructional design,
  and show them how those ideas relate to teaching programming.
  We do this for two reasons:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    There's always a fair bit of improvising in Software Carpentry bootcamps.
    The more the instructors know about the basics&mdash;in particular,
    the more knowledge they <em>share</em> about the basics&mdash;the
    easier it will be for them to accommodate local circumstances.
  </li>
  <li>
    Most of their teaching is going to be on other topics, not Software Carpentry,
    so covering the fundamentals maximizes value.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The content is continually evolving,
  but is anchored by some combination of the following exercises:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Create a concept map for a five-minute lesson on a topic of their choosing.</em>
      As well as introducing concept maps
      (which are useful for both preparing and presenting material),
      this exercise gets them thinking about how much more there is in any given topic than they first think.
      It also gets them talking to one another:
      one of our goals is to get instructors used to giving peers feedback,
      and accepting it in turn.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Create some multiple choice questions for formative assessment (again, for one small topic).</em>
      Here we make analogies with test-driven development:
      if you don't know how to tell whether someone has learned something or not,
      you're not ready to teach it.
      We also ask them think about creating distractors (the wrong answers to the MCQs)
      that will give them insight into their learners' misconceptions,
      and once again to give each other feedback.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Make a three-minute screencast.</em>
      Teaching is a performance art;
      this exercise gives us our first insight into how well participants can perform,
      without being quite as frightening as recording yourself in front of an audience.
      It also teaches them just how hard it is to make a decent video:
      2-3 hours for a 3-minute screencast isn't unusual.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Tell a story.</em>
      Motivation is often the most important factor determing whether or not someone learns something.
      It's easy to list off things that <em>demotivate</em> people who are trying to learn to program;
      in this exercise,
      we have trainees tell us what they would do when first introducing a topic
      to help motivate people to learn it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Work with a partner to update or extend one of our lessons.</em>
      This was only introduced in Round 6,
      but should have been part of the training right from the start.
      While our learning materials are organized in a much simpler way than they were a year ago,
      it's still hard for new instructors
      (particularly those who aren't familiar with GitHub and website compilation tools)
      to figure out what's where and how to use it.
      We'll be putting more emphasis on this going forward,
      in part because we hope that instructors will contribute more material
      if they're more familiar with the mechanics of doing so.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Teach a topic at a bootcamp and reflect on how it went.</em>
      Which pretty much explains itself.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Here's what I've learned from doing this seven times in the last year and a half:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>The most important lesson for participants is that we actually know a lot about learning.</em>
      As Mark Guzdial has <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2014/01/31/big-data-vs-old-psychology-work-harder-vs-work-smarter/">pointed out</a> repeatedly,
      educational psychologists know a lot of useful things,
      but most people in other fields aren't aware of that.
      Whether it's academic insularity,
      the disdain people in "hard" science feel for anything involving people,
      or the fact that
      <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2012/09/the-real-hard-work.html">many creative people would rather work for a week than read for an hour</a>,
      most of the participants in our training
      are blown away by what's in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Learning-Works-Research-Based-Principles/dp/0470484101/">How Learning Works</a></em>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>The sense of community created by the training is as important as the training itself.</em>
      People come out of this course with some new friends and a sense of mission.
      In the long run,
      those things are probably as important to the health of Software Carpentry
      as the quality of our instruction.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>People are busy.</em>
      <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2013/12/instructor-stats.html">Half or more of each cohort drops out</a>,
      and even when we push back a meeting to give people extra time to complete an exercise,
      quite a few won't be able to do it.
      The reason is simple:
      real life gets in the way.
      It's important that we don't say, "This will just take a couple of hours,"
      because training course participants don't have those hours
      any more than we do.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The question now is where we go next.
  The Mozilla Webmaker team is launching <a href="http://www.zythepsary.com/education/webmaker-training-why-modular/">a new training program</a>
  focusing on how to teach peopel the web.
  Like us,
  they believe that you don't have to know theory to teach,
  but understanding it can make you a better teacher.
  Their training will be more modular than ours,
  so that people can come and learn the thing they want without having to focus in on things they're not interested in.
  The biggest difference is scale:
  they hope to train 1000 mentors in the coming months,
  which is almost ten times as many people as we have in our entire instructor pool.
  I'm hoping to take part in at least one of their events,
  and to swap ideas and lessons
  (particularly related to data and privacy on the web,
  which are increasingly important to scientists).
  If you'd like to take part as well,
  the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/Training">road map</a> includes a list of upcoming events.
</p>
<p>
  To wrap up,
  I'd like to congratulate our latest cohort of trainees:
  it was a pleasure learning with you,
  and I hope we have a chance to share a classroom some time soon.

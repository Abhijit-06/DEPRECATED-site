  When Brent Gorda and I started Software Carpentry in 1998,
  our goal was to help our colleagues get more done in less time,
  and with less pain,
  by teaching them a few basic lab skills for scientific computing.
  As the project grew,
  I realized that this problem wasn't specific to scientists:
  almost everyone who uses the web spends hours or days doing things
  that a few simple programs could do for them
  faster and more reliably.

  Since Software Carpentry became part of the Mozilla Science Lab last summer,
  we've been thinking long and hard not only about how we can scale our existing efforts,
  but also help connect the many dots that make up open science on the web.
  Lots of people are doing exciting things,
  but most of those things don't yet work together,
  and most of those people either don't know each other,
  or haven't yet found a way to connect.
</p>
<p>
  The good news is that lots of other groups are trying to figure this out as well.
  In particular,
  Mozilla's <a href="https://webmaker.org/">Webmaker</a> team is
  a global community dedicated to teaching digital skills.
  Their focus is digital literacy:
  they explore, tinker, and create to help people learn how to build a web that's open and collaborative.
  Like us,
  their goal isn't to create the next generation of professional programmers;
  instead,
  we want to democratize these skills
  so that everyone knows enough to make what they need to solve their day-to-day problems,
  whatever those may be.
</p>
<p>
  Last year,
  Webmaker ran its first training session for the mentors
  who actually do this kind of grassroots teaching.
  They're scaling up their efforts this year in a big way:
  they hope to train 1000 mentors in the coming months,
  which is almost ten times as many people as we have in our entire instructor pool.
  Their <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/Training">road map</a> includes a list of upcoming events,
  all of which are intended to lower barriers to entry
  so that everyone can make, create, remix and build on the web.
</p>
<p>
  Superficially,
  Webmaker and Software Carpentry teach different skills&mdash;Webmaker
  focuses on front-end technologies like HTML5 and CSS,
  while Software Carpentry's focus is the back-end tools needed to move data around and analyze it&mdash;but
  under the hood,
  what both really teach is
  <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2011/01/24/seven-ways-to-think-like-the-web/">how to think like the web</a>.
  While specific tools come and go,
  basic ideas like remixing instead of rewriting
  and sharing instead of just showing
  are here to stay,
  and <em>those</em> are what make the difference.
</p>
<p>
  We believe that we need to build capacity in order to strengthen and accelerate open research.
  We also believe that open research is just one special case of "open".
  Over the next year,
  we'll be looking at how we can engage Software Carpentry's learners in larger efforts,
  both in science and in society at large.
  If you'd like to help us, or Webmaker,
  please get in touch.

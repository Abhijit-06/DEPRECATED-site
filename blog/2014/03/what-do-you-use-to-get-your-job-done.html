<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
Some of you may have heart of <a href="http://usesthis.com">usesthis.com</a>.
In this site people are interviewed about the tools they use to get their job
done. The format is very straight forward, participants have to answer these
questions:
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->

<ul>
        <li> Who are you, and what do you do?
        <li> What hardware do you use?
        <li> And what software?
        <li> What would be your dream setup?
</ul>

<p>
I find the site useful and engaging. I thought it would be useful to have
something similar but more oriented towards scientists and developers. That is
why I decided to write my own <a href="http://github.com/drio/rollswiththis">version</a>.
</p>

<p>
I haven't launched yet as I am waiting to get enough interviews to release one
or two per week.
</p>

<p>
What do you think about the idea? Do you think it would be useful? Do you have
suggestions to make it better? Questions?
</p>

<p>
Obviously the swc has lots of individuals whose interviews would be very
relevant for the site. That's why I am asking if you'd like to participate
by writing your own interview. If so, please send me an email with your answers
to the questions and a portrait photo that I can attach to the interview. Go to
the usesthis site if you are looking for inspiration.
</p>

<p>
I am sure you also know a lot of interesting people whose interviews would be
relevant. Please, tell me about them.
</p>

Thank you!

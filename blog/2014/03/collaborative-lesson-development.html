<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>A few weeks ago, Greg Wilson asked me a question that he has been thinking 
about for a while:

<blockquote>Why is there so little open, collaborative development of lesson plans and 
curricula? Is there something that makes teaching different from coding (e.g., 
open source software) and from writing (e.g., Wikipedia)?
</blockquote>

A dozen emails later, I can't claim that we're much closer to a definitive 
answer, but we have come up with a working hypothesis that's summarized below. 
We'd be very interested in comments, criticisms, extensions, or any other 
feedback on these ideas.</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->

<p>
To begin, three key ingredients appear to be required for collaborative 
development of any sort of material: a host, lead developers/maintainers, and 
contributors. The host provides the infrastructure for the project, the 
developers/maintainers integrate and manage contributions, and contributors 
create the actual materials themselves.
</p><p>
For example, the continued development of IPython requires (1) GitHub, (2) 
Fernando P&eacute;rez and the core developers, and (3) scientists/coders who 
understand pull requests. The growth of Wikipedia required (1) the Wikimedia 
Foundation, (2) the core admins, and (3) interested readers who understand how 
to use a browser-based Wiki editor.
</p><p>
Under this framework, the lack of development of open, collaborative lessons 
could be due to a shortcoming in any of these three key areas.
</p><p>
Greg's vote is that the biggest limitation is in #2. While there are lots of 
people in education with backgrounds in writing and who can edit lessons plans, 
these people appear to have avoided stepping into the broader role of managing 
the development of collaborative materials. The existence of edited books 
suggests that, in principle, this shouldn't seem like a strange activity.
</p><p>
My vote is that the biggest limitation is #3, given that contributors need a 
certain level of technical skill to use the tools that enable contributions 
(version control, a browser-based Wiki editor). I suspect that these skills are 
perhaps lacking among educators, whereas they're not lacking to the same extent 
among coders or even among Wikipedia readers.
</p><p>
Of course, an interesting exception (that to some extent proves the rule) is 
provided by the lesson materials developed by Software Carpentry. Software 
Carpentry arguably works because of (1) GitHub, (2) Greg Wilson, and (3) 
instructors who understand pull requests. The first and third of these are 
possible largely because the contributors to the Software Carpentry lessons 
are, by design, also scientists and coders.
</p><p>
Importantly, the interventions required to promote collaborative lesson 
material development will depend on where the bottleneck lies.
</p>

<ol>
<li>	If the shortcoming is in hosting and infrastructure, somebody needs to 
    fund, maintain, and (most importantly) advertise a central website for open 
    curriculum development. <a href="http://www.curriki.org/">Curriki</a> appears to be 
    having a go at this. An important design consideration should be to make 
    the skill level required for contribution to be as low as possible (think 
    Wiki editor rather than fork/pull).

<li> 	If the shortcoming is in developers/maintainers, a set of current leaders 
	in education in teaching different subjects (perhaps exemplary high school 
	teachers or professors at primarily teaching institutions) need to 
	volunteer or be offered incentives to play a lead role in developing and managing 
	a set of materials for their areas of expertise. This role could and should 
	be recognized as equivalent to being the editor of a published book.

<li> 	If the shortcoming is in the contributors, training in collaborative web 
	tools should be provided to educators who express interest in the ideas of 
	open lesson development. While incentives could also be useful here, it's 
    notable that contributors to open source software and Wikipedia generally 
    receive no direct compensation for their work.
</ol>

<p>
Or, maybe all of this is a work in progress and we just need 
to wait for the next generation of tech-savvy educators (and students).
</p><p>
So, that's about as far as we've gotten. What do you think?

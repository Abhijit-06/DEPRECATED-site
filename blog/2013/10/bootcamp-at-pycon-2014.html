<p>
  Thanks to the generous support of the Python Software Foundation,
  we will be running our biggest bootcamp ever in conjunction with PyCon 2014
  in Montreal on April 14-15, 2014.
  We will have two rooms with seating for 50 people and two more with seating for 80,
  so our plan is to run three regular bootcamps for people of varying skill levels,
  and one more "master class" for scientists who are ready to learn more advanced topics.
</p>
<p>
  Our audience for these bootcamps isn't PyCon attendees&mdash;we think
  most of them will already know most of what we teach.
  Instead,
  the audience is scientists in Montreal, Ottawa, Kingston, Quebec City,
  and the northeastern United States.
  What we <em>do</em> hope is to recruit as many Pythonistas as we can as helpers
  both to give learners the best experience possible
  and to give the Python community a look at what we do and how we do it.
  We'll have more details in January,
  but we're already excited,
  and hope to see many of you there.

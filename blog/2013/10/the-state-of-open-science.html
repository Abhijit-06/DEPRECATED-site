<p>
  This past Saturday,
  as part of the biannual Mozilla Summit,
  John Jensen presented a report on the health of the open web.
  The details were fascinating,
  and are summed up in a graphic showing how
  the various layers of openness that we all depend on
  are doing.
  I've reproduced it on the left,
  and summarized my view of how open science is doing by those same measures on the right:

<p>
  Here are Jensen's analysis
  (based on tons of data)
  and mine
  (which are mostly opinion)
  from the bottom up:
</p>
<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Area</th>
    <th>Open Web</th>
    <th>Open Science</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Access</strong></td>
    <td width="45%" bgcolor="#44FF44">
      A third of the world's people have regular access to the Internet,
      and only 2% live in countries that are almost completely disconnected from it
      (Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Uzbekistan).
      On the other hand,
      only one tenth of Americans with disabilities ever use the Internet.
    </td>
    <td width="45%" bgcolor="#FFFF44">
      Most scientists in industrialized countries have reliable web access,
      and those in developing countries tend to have better access than their fellow citizens.
      However,
      most don't have the skills they need to actually <em>do</em> something with that access.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Interoperability</strong></td>
    <td bgcolor="#FFFF44">
      Modern browsers are mostly compatible with each other.
    </td>
    <td bgcolor="#FF4444">
      Scientific services mostly don't talk to each other&mdash;just think of
      how many overall years of effort scientists will spend <em>today</em>
      moving data from one silo to another.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Content Freedom</strong></td>
    <td bgcolor="#44FF44">
      Governments are trying hard to control who can see what,
      but we are still largely free to read, see, and say what we want.
    </td>
    <td bgcolor="#FF4444">
      Bwah hah hah...
      Despite the best efforts of a great many hard-working visionaries,
      most scientific papers and data sets are still locked away behind paywalls.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Innovation</strong></td>
    <td bgcolor="#FFFF44">
      Most of the excitement has been on mobile devices and tablets in recent years.
    </td>
    <td bgcolor="#44FF44">
      A ton of new ideas and services have appeared in the last couple of years,
      and there's no sign of the rush slowing down.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Diversity of<br/>Services</strong></td>
    <td bgcolor="#FFFF44">
      As you go up the stack, diversity diminishes.
      For example,
      no single network operator dominates the web,
      but by the time you reach operating systems we're down to three,
      and when you reach social networks and search engines,
      there's really only one of each.
    </td>
    <td bgcolor="#FFFF44">
      There are many variations on a small number of themes (think data archiving).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>User Choice<br/>&amp; Control</strong></td>
    <td bgcolor="#FF4444">
      Lots on the desktop,
      but the mobile and tablet markets are really dominated by Safari.
      More importantly,
      perhaps,
      users don't control their identities:
      Facebook, Google, and Yahoo! do.
    </td>
    <td bgcolor="#FFFF44">
      No one player dominates science on the web
      the way Apple, Google, and Facebook dominate the web in general.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Social<br/>Activity</strong></td>
    <td bgcolor="#44FF44">
      on the one hand,
      Facebook is 83% of online social time.
      On the other hand,
      legislation like SOPA and PIPA has repeatedly been beaten back.
    </td>
    <td bgcolor="#44FF44">
      If we take "social" to be "the human side of science",
      including things like conferences,
      then we're doing pretty well.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Economic<br/>Activity</strong></td>
    <td bgcolor="#FF4444">
      E-commerce dominates,
      but next in line is advertising,
      and that's a near monopoly.
    </td>
    <td bgcolor="#FFFF44">
      The business of science&mdash;things like paper reviews&mdash;is now conducted almost entirely through the web,
      but most of the software and services used are black boxes controlled by a small number of players.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Trust</strong></td>
    <td bgcolor="#FF4444">
      "Internet &amp; Social Media" was 25th out of 25 industries in a survey of who people trust.
      We're less trusted than banks and airlines...
    </td>
    <td bgcolor="#44FF44">
      Scientists seem to trust the things they use to do science online.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  If this analysis is right,
  then it's pretty clear where open science advocates need to concentrate their efforts:
  institutional change to open up content,
  and technical change to get the pieces of the open web we already have
  to talk to each other without heroic effort.

  The first Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE)
  is going to be held in conjunction with <a href="http://sc13.supercomputing.org/">Supercomputing 2013</a>
  on Sunday, November 17.
  I read all of
  <a href="http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/contributions/">the papers listed on the workshop site</a>
  over the weekend,
  and my reaction was this:
</p>

<p>
  My dictionary defines "sustainable" as
  "able to be maintained at a certain rate or level."
  Anyone who has worked in public health or international development can tell you
  that the most important requirement for sustainability is education.
  If people know how to do something for themselves,
  and understand <em>why</em> they should do it,
  they'll find ways to keep it going and adapt it to their specific needs.
  This is why the mass public health campaigns in the middle of the 20th Century
  invested so much effort in teaching people about germs and nutrition:
  once people understand how tuberculosis spreads,
  for examlpe,
  they can figure out for themselves what to do about people sneezing and spitting in public.
</p>
<p>
  If either the how or the why is missing,
  though,
  people will stop doing whatever it is you want them to do
  as soon as the external incentive (i.e., the funding) dries up.
  This is why I was left unmoved by most of the 49 papers I read.
  About half are single-site experience reports devoted to
  programs that are just getting off the ground
  (e.g., classes that have only been run once)
  or to scalable, easy-to-use software packages.
  (Funnily enough, they're <em>all</em> scalable and easy to use...)
  When they mention education and training,
  that's as much mention as they get:
  the words "education and training".
</p>
<p>
  Others discuss a grab bag of topics ranging from software maturity models to the Semantic Web,
  but those too give no more than a passing bullet point to the fact that
  scientists need to know how to drive these things in order to adopt and sustain them.
  As just one example,
  <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1813">this paper</a>
  from a group at Argonne National Lab
  presents a diagram of the user engagement cycle
  that includes a "tech improvement" step,
  but doesn't have one for "user improvement".
  As another,
  Blanton and Lenhardt's
  "<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.789028">A User Perspective on Sustainable Scientific Software</a>"
  starts by framing discussion of sustainability in terms of risk,
  but then blows it by saying:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
  Hedging against this risk has several aspects, all related to the
  development of the software itself. In some rough order of
  increasing complexity, these range from adoption and adherence of
  software development best practices, to peer-review of software, to
  formal training in software engineering and related fields for
  scientists.
</em></blockquote>
<p>
  This is just plain wrong.
  Without training in software development,
  best practices cannot be adopted:
  they can only be repeated by rote,
  and that breaks down sooner rather than later.
</p>
<p>
  Of course,
  in a collection this size,
  it would be surprising if nobody tackled the issue of fundamental skills explicitly.
  One paper that does so&mdash;my favorite in the set&mdash;is
  "<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1817">Initial Findings from a Study of Best Practices and Models for Cyberinfrastructure Software Sustainability</a>",
  by Stewart, Wernet, Barnet, and Welch.
  They surveyed 5000 NSF-funded PIs (of whom 811 responded),
  then interviewed the leaders of a dozen projects.
  One of their conclusions is that:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
  ...the vast number of principal investigators and researchers in the
  scientific domain lack the training, expertise, awareness, time,
  and, in some cases, inclination or aptitude to become functionally
  proficient in these areas crucial to sustainability.
</em></blockquote>
<p>
  They also make some interesting proposals, such as:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
  A small-business boot camp designed around the tolerances and
  motivations of scientists and researchers should be developed to, at
  a minimum, provide an overview of these areas and proactively create
  an awareness of the key components required for sustainability.
</em></blockquote>
<p>
  They even advocate the creation of a software sustainability institute,
  presumably modeled on <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/">the one that's been so successful in the UK</a>.
  But nowhere do they say,
  "We need to train people to <em>create</em> sustainable software."
  Trying to curate the code that most scientists create is a hopeless task;
  if we want software to be reused,
  we have to teach people how to write reusable software.
</p>
<p>
  As I was re-reading my notes,
  though,
  I was struck by the fact that
  papers from groups that had been around a long time
  were more likely than others to talk about the importance of education.
  One example is <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1796">the paper describing VisIt</a>,
  which has a subsection called "Education" under the heading "Fostering Community".
  In it,
  the authors say:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
  ...an instructor goes through features one by one, and
  the students reproduce the results. The class has one- and two-day
  versions and has been very well received. The classes taught at
  computing centers appear to have a correlation to tool
  adoption. Unfortunately, in contrast with tutorials that can be
  easily offered at conferences, classes are a less traditional format
  for HPC tools. As a result, the class is taught less frequently and
  has generally only been taught at institutions who wish to provide
  training for their specific users.
</em></blockquote>
<p>
  and also:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
  We have found that the developer team grows by existing developers
  hiring new developers at their own institution and training
  them. Often, the project spreads to new institutions from developer
  migration, not from new developers at a site picking up the tool and
  learning it in isolation. This may indicate a failure in terms of
  fostering developer community, but we note that the goal is hard;
  learning how to develop a program that exceeds a million lines of
  code is difficult even with excellent documentation.
</em></blockquote>
<p>
  They're write:
  developing on top of such a large code base <em>is</em> hard.
  The way we tackle that kind of difficulty in other fields is
  by teaching people core skills:
  carbon dating for archeologists,
  double-blind A/B testing for pharmacologists,
  and version control for computationalists.
  Except of course we usually skip the latter...
</p>
<p>
  Another example is <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.790756">the paper from the Kitware team</a>,
  who have been building world-class software for more than fifteen years.
  Their visualization library was originally developed to support a textbook,
  and this has clearly influenced their view of the world:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
  ...the standard of software engineering in science must be improved,
  and sustainable software ecosystems with meaningful credit must be
  realized. This is not simply limited to teaching scientists to write
  code; if sustainable software projects are to be established in
  science then issues such as testing, licensing, and collaboration
  must be addressed. Sufficient engineering discipline is required to
  realize robust foundations that can be extended through the use of
  code review, regression testing and proper citation and attribution
  of software used in research.
</em></blockquote>
<p>
  Finally,
  there is
  "<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.791560">Software Engineering as Instrumentation for the Long Tail of Scientific Software</a>",
  by Huang and Lapp.
  They accurately diagnose the problem:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
  ...long tail tools are by and large developed by
  researcher-developers whose career priorities, scientific interests,
  and training are primarily in their domain science. Successfully
  optimizing software to reduce or eliminate barriers to reuse takes
  training in the science of software engineering...which even more
  experienced researcher-developers often do not have. Those that do
  are not rewarded for it by the academic incentive structure, which
  by and large provides little recognition for effort devoted to
  engineering improvements unless it is immediately evident how such
  effort enables new science. Correspondingly, among many domain
  scientists, awareness of software engineering benefits and
  appreciation for its cost are low....
</em></blockquote>
<p>
  Their solutions?
</p>
<blockquote><em>
  One is changing the reward structure to better recognize the
  immediate and near-term benefits of well-engineered software.
</em></blockquote>
<p>
  While laudable,
  this isn't going to happen any time soon.
  However:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
  The other...is reducing the costs to science [by] creating an
  effective infrastructure for scientists for securing software
  engineering services [from] a non-profit center-of-excellence
  model...
  <br/>
  The center would pool the small and otherwise disparate fractions of
  software engineering effort. It would recruit personnel with deep
  training in software engineering and knowledge across a scientific
  discipline sufficient to collaborate effectively with scientists
  across a domain...
</em></blockquote>
<p>
  Based on what we've learned so far from our (small, preliminary) code review project,
  I believe that scientists and developers will only be able to collaborate effectively
  if the scientists know a fair bit about good software practices
  (and equally if the developers know a fair bit about the science).
  I therefore think that an institute of this kind will only survive and thrive
  if its top priority is educating its audience,
  just as rural clinics in developing countries only become self-supporting
  when the people they're trying to help understand <em>why</em> it's important that midwives wash their hands
  and children be vaccinated.
</p>
<p>
  So here's <em>my</em> diagram of the scientific software lifecycle:
</p>
<div align="center"><img src="wssspe-cycle.png" alt="It's All About the Skills" /></div>
<p>
  A scientist needs coding skills to turn models and algorithms into working software.
  She needs more of those skills to run that software,
  and to analyze the data it produces;
  I'd even argue that she needs those skills in order to translate
  her new scientific insights into the next generation of models and algorithms,
  because if you don't know how to build things,
  how can you possibly know what it's possible to build?
</p>
<p>
  I won't be at WSSSPE,
  but if I was,
  I'd have just one message for attendees.
  Nothing you want is going to happen unless you teach scientists basic computing skills:
  not "someone", but <em>you</em>.
  It isn't sufficient,
  but it's as necessary as it is neglected.
</p>

  The first Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE)
  is going to be held in conjunction with <a href="http://sc13.supercomputing.org/">Supercomputing 2013</a>
  on Sunday, November 17.
  I read all of
  <a href="http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/contributions/">the papers listed on the workshop site</a>
  over the weekend,
  and in a picture,
  my reaction is this:

<p>
  My dictionary defines "sustainable" as
  "able to be maintained at a certain rate or level."
  Anyone who has worked in public health or international development can tell you,
  the most important requirement for sustainability isn't actually funding:
  it's education.
  If people know how to do something for themselves,
  and understand <em>why</em> they should do it,
  they'll find a way to keep it going.
  This is why the mass public health campaigns in the middle of the 20th Century
  invested so much effort in teaching people about germs and nutrition:
  once people understand that tuberculosis spreads in sputum,
  or that rickets is caused by a shortage of Vitamin D,
  they can figure out for themselves how to stop their neighbors from spitting in the streets
  and how to get their kids more time in the sun.
  If either the how or the why is missing,
  though,
  people will stop doing whatever it is you want them to do
  as soon as the external incentive (i.e., the funding) dries up.
</p>
<p>
  This is why I was left unmoved by most of the 49 papers I read.
  About half are single-site experience reports,
  often devoted to scalable, easy-to-use software packages.
  (Funnily enough, they're <em>all</em> scalable and easy to use...)
  When they mention education and training,
  that's as much mention as they get:
  the words "education and training".
  Others discuss a grab bag of topics ranging from software maturity models to the Semantic Web,
  but those too give no more than a passing bullet point to the fact that
  scientists need to know how to drive these things in order to adopt and sustain them.
</p>
<p>
  As just one example,
  <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1813">one of the papers from Argonne National Lab</a>
  presents a diagram of the user engagement cycle
  that includes a "tech improvement" step,
  but doesn't have one for "user improvement".
  Another example is <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.790756">the paper from the Kitware team</a>,
  who have been building world-class software for more than fifteen years.
  Their visualization library was originally developed to support a textbook,
  and this has clearly influenced their view of the world:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
  ...the standard of software engineering in science must be improved,
  and sustainable software ecosystems with meaningful credit must be
  realized. This is not simply limited to teaching scientists to write
  code; if sustainable software projects are to be established in
  science then issues such as testing, licensing, and collaboration
  must be addressed. Sufficient engineering discipline is required to
  realize robust foundations that can be extended through the use of
  code review, regression testing and proper citation and attribution
  of software used in research.
  <br/>
  ...
  <br/>
  Scientific projects often have limited resources, with a high
  turnover of developers/engineers as they move through their academic
  careers. This means that it is essential to establish procedures to
  help new community members get up to speed, and to retain group
  knowledge as people move on to new positions.
</em></blockquote>
<p>
  But when, where, and how do they expect people to learn the skills
  they so clearly depend on?
</p>
<p>
  Blanton and Lenhardt's
  "<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.789028">A User Perspective on Sustainable Scientific Software</a>",
  meanwhile,
  is just wrong-headed.
  They start by framing discussion of sustainability in terms of risk,
  which I found useful,
  but then say:
</p>
<blockquote></em>
  Hedging against this risk has several aspects, all related to the
  development of the software itself. In some rough order of
  increasing complexity, these range from adoption and adherence of
  software development best practices, to peer-review of software, to
  formal training in software engineering and related fields for
  scientists.
</em></blockquote>
<p>
  I strongly disagree:
  without training in software development,
  best practices cannot be adopted:
  they can only be repeated by rote,
  which breaks down sooner rather than later.
</p>
<p>
  Of course,
  in a collection this size,
  it would be surprising if nobody tackled the skills issue explicitly.
  One paper that does so is
  "<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1817">Initial Findings from a Study of Best Practices and Models for Cyberinfrastructure Software Sustainability</a>",
  by Stewart, Wernet, Barnet, and Welch.
  They surveyed 5000 NSF-funded PIs (of whom 811 responded),
  then interviewed the leaders of a dozen projects.
  One of their conclusions is that:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
  ...the vast number of principal investigators and researchers in the
  scientific domain lack the training, expertise, awareness, time,
  and, in some cases, inclination or aptitude to become functionally
  proficient in these areas crucial to sustainability.
</em></blockquote>
<p>
  They also make some interesting evidence-based proposals:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
  A small-business boot camp designed around the tolerances and
  motivations of scientists and researchers should be developed to, at
  a minimum, provide an overview of these areas and proactively create
  an awareness of the key components required for sustainability.
</em></blockquote>
<p>
  They even advocate the creation of a software sustainability institute,
  presumably modeled on <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/">the one that's been so successful in the UK</a>.
  But nowhere do they say,
  "We need to train people to <em>create</em> sustainable software."
</p>
<p>
  There is also
  "<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.791560">Software Engineering as Instrumentation for the Long Tail of Scientific Software</a>",
  by Huang and Lapp.
  They accurately diagnose the problem:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
  ...long tail tools are by and large developed by
  researcher-developers whose career priorities, scientific interests,
  and training are primarily in their domain science. Successfully
  optimizing software to reduce or eliminate barriers to reuse takes
  training in the science of software engineering...which even more
  experienced researcher-developers often do not have. Those that do
  are not rewarded for it by the academic incentive structure, which
  by and large provides little recognition for effort devoted to
  engineering improvements unless it is immediately evident how such
  effort enables new science. Correspondingly, among many domain
  scientists, awareness of software engineering benefits and
  appreciation for its cost are low....In this climate, the human
  talent in software engineering that academia has is eventually lost
  to industry...in part because universities offer little in the way
  of alternative career tracks for such people.
</em></blockquote>
<p>
  Their solutions?
</p>
<blockquote><em>
  One is changing the reward structure to better recognize the
  immediate and near-term benefits of well-engineered software.
</em></blockquote>
<p>
  While laudable,
  this isn't going to happen any time soon.
  However:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
  The other...is reducing the costs to science [by] creating an
  effective infrastructure for scientists for securing software
  engineering services [from] a non-profit center-of-excellence
  model...
  <br/>
  The center would pool the small and otherwise disparate fractions of
  software engineering effort. It would recruit personnel with deep
  training in software engineering and knowledge across a scientific
  discipline sufficient to collaborate effectively with scientists
  across a domain...
  <br/>
  Importantly, the center would complement, assist, and train the
  individual scientist-developer rather than taking away from their
  intellectual and other ownership in the long tail tools.
</em></blockquote>
<p>
  I don't know if this would work,
  but at least it's tackling the central problem head-on.

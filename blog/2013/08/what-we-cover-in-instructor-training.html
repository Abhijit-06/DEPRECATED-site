<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>FIXME: explain the syllabus for instructor training (has now evolved to a relatively stable form).</p>
<ol>
  <li><cite>How Learning Works</cite> and Guzdial's chapter</li>
  <li>Concept map</li>
  <li>Assessment questions (novice vs competent, competent vs expert)</li>
  <li>Make a screencast (always takes a lot longer than expected)</li>
  <li>Critique an existing screencast</li>
  <li>Help someone online and explain how to tell if it was better/worse/the same as in person or recorded video</li>
  <li>Capstone exercise: create, deliver, and evaluate a lesson</li>
  <li>Wrap-up (reflection)</li>
</ol>
<p>Taken out:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a conventional presentation (waste of time)</li>
  <li>FIXME: others?</li>
</ul>
<p>To add: demonstrate mastery of SWC's content (kind of a major oversight)</p>

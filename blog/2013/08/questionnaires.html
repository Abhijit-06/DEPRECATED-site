<p>
  Thanks to some hard work by Jory Schossau and others,
  we have developed three standard questionnaires for bootcamp participants:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/pre-learner.html">Pre-assessment for Learners</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/post-learner.html">Post-assessment for Learners</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/post-instructor.html">Post-assessment for Instructors</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  We hope to deploy these questionnaires starting in September,
  so we would be very grateful for feedback:
  do you feel you understand what we're asking,
  do the responses provided include the answer you would give,
  and anything else you can think of.

<p>
Close on the heels of another bootcamp in Madison, WI, 
for the past two weeks I had the pleasure of teaching a 30 hour scientific 
computing course at the <a href="http://aims.ac.za/">African Institute for 
Mathematical Sciences</a> (AIMS) in Cape Town, South Africa.  The course was an 
expansion and refactor of Sofware Carpentry material to fit the AIMS need.

repository of source material here</a>.

While I could gush about how I fell in love with Cape Town, the 
unexpected preponderance of vegan places in Muizenberg, the sea, the sand, 
the mountains, and <a style="text-style:italic;">la dolce vita</a> I am otherwise 
used to from Santa Barbara I will not.  AIMS is about the students.  Let's examine
them first.

<h3>AIMS</h3>

AIMS, in association with its partner universities, provides a one year technical 
masters degree to exceptional students from all over Africa.  This provides a needed
stepping stone for many of them to pursue other universities across Africa and across
the wolrd that they would otherwise likely not have to oppurtunity to attend.
The social goals go hand in hand with the technical mission.  

AIMS in Cape Town is the first such center and was opened in 2013.  However, other 
AIMS centers are sprining up in various other contries on what seems like an annual
basis.  There is also an associated research center which houses some doctoral and
post-doctoral students as well as an associate center dedicated to improving the 
educational methods of secondary school teachers.

AIMS itself is a 4 storey, 0 indexed building less than 100 meters from the ocean.  
Floor 0 contains a lecture hall, offices, kitchen and dining area.  Floor 1 has 
more offices, the library, and a world class computer lab.  Floor 2 houses the 
student dormitories.  Floor 3 houses rooms for some staff and visitors, such as 
myself. In short AIMS is mathematics monestary straight from my undergraduate 
physics major dreams.

<h3>The Students</h3>

This year's class is approximately 50 students and hail from Egypt to Chad to Nairobi
to South  Africa itself.  In the neighborhood of 20 countries were represented in 
the student body. As William, a student, put it "by visiting AIMS I visited all of 
Africa."  This is where the diversity starts.

40% - 50% of the students were women.  It seemed that the age distribution ranged 
from mid-twenties to mid-forties. Though the ability to read and understand English 
was generally quite high, the ability to speak or understand spoken English varied 
from fluent to novice.

Technical ability was also all over the map.  Some of the students it seemed had been
professional Java developers in a past life.  On the other hand there were some 
students who had learned to program Pascal out of a book and arriving at AIMS the 
week before was their first time ever using a computer.  

Teaching to the middle 80% would not have worked.  The distributions of abilities 
along too many axes were flat rather than normal. Still, the students themselves 
were incredibly enthusiastic.  Far more so than their Western counterparts 
I have taught.  The computer lab is open 24/7.  I would often pop in between 11 pm 
and midight.  Categorically I would find 20 - 30 students
<a style="text-style:italic;">still</a> in at their machines, working through 
the day's material, and discussing what they were learning in small groups.

<h3>The Stack</h3>

<h3>The Course</h3>

It became clear after the first few lessons
 - intro, BASH, git - that I would have to adapt my teaching style.
Luckily, they all shared an
advanced mathematics background.  I could assume that they all knew linear algebra, 
differential equations, and set theory.


No Py BootCamp, some course material changed -- some did not

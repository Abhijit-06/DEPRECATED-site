Recently I was challenged to show that computational science is important to 
biologists, and, more importantly, that biologists care about learning how to 
develop quality software.  I am <i>not</i> a biologist.  While I find the 
subject facinating I cannot make any broad claims or hope to speak for all 
biologists.  So I turned to Software Carpentry.
</p>

<p>
My experiance teaching Software Carpentry and related bootcamps has been that 
biologists are always a significant portion of the student population.  In order
to demonstrate this I asked to have access to anonymized answers to the 
"Which of the following most closely aligns with your primary discipline?"
question of 
<a href="http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/pre-learner.html">the pre-assement survey</a>.
With a big assist from Amy Brown I obtained the data I was looking for.

Almost immeadtely, I was confronted with the problem of who exactly is a biologist, 
physicist, and so on.  The pre-assement survey option are too fine grained for 
purposes here.  For example, I consider astrophysicist and geologists both to be 
physicists.  Furthermore, since the survey question is a checkbox type the students
could select multiple options which may span multiple domains.  Finally, there 
is that pesky "Other" option which allows the students to sumbit anything.  
For exmaple, which domain does the discipline "Data Analysis" go in? 
All of them I hope.  This survey question does not yield a clean taxonomy.
</p>

<p>
To coarsen the data, I chose the following five domains to group disciplines 
into: physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics & computer science, and 
humanities & social science.  Is this grossly unfair to some disciplines? Check.
Does it work? Double check.  In the spirit of openness, all of the data and anlysis
is available at 
<a href="https://github.com/scopatz/swc-bc-student-domains">this repository</a>.
You can also view 
<a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/scopatz/swc-bc-student-domains/master/domains.ipynb">the IPython notebook</a> 
where I did my analysis. Feel free to criticize my groupings in the comments.
</p>

<p>
The data that Amy provided me with was collected from 306 students over the 
past 9 or 10 bootcamps that have been run.  This is definitely a decent enough 
sample size to be able to say something meaningful about the student populous.
From <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> & <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>, we can see that 
my intuition turned out to be correct.
</p>

Note that these percentages sum to greater than 100% because students may select
more that one discipline during the pre-assement survey.

<p>
Roughly a third of the participants in the bootcamps come from a biologically 
oriented field!  This is second only to the physics-related diciplines.  Moreover, 
the biolgists far outstrip their counterparts in the other domains.  So if 
Software Carpentry bootcamps are any measure of interest in software development
best practices - and I think they are - then it is clear that biology domain is
thriving.

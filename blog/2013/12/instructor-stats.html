<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  We recently wrapped up
  <a href="two-to-the-fifth-instructors.html">the latest round of instructor training</a>,
  which means this is a good time to look at how well the program is doing.
  Here are stats on the first six rounds:

<table>
<tr><th>Round</th><th>Enrolled</th><th>Completed</th></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td><td>20</td><td align="right">11 (55%)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td><td>25</td><td align="right">11 (44%)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td><td>13</td><td align="right">2 (18%)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>4</td><td>27</td><td align="right">13 (48%)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>5</td><td>45</td><td align="right">12 (25%)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>6</td><td>41</td><td align="right">18 (44%)</td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td>171</td><td>67 (39%)</td></tr>
  </table>
<p>
  A 39% completion rate would be nothing to brag about in a regular classroom,
  but it's several times higher than most online courses achieve,
  and 67 new instructors in 18 months has let us reach many more people.
  57 people are currently taking part in our seventh cohort,
  and 69 will start in mid-January
  (at which point we'll almost certainly scale back to classes of 40 or so&mdash;it's
  proving too hard to coordinate larger groups).

  As regular readers will know,
  I'm a big fan of <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com">Mark Guzdial</a>'s work
  on computing education.
  Last week,
  he <a href="https://twitter.com/guzdial/status/413374893141413888">tweeted</a> this:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Google is made of people who succeed in current CS teaching model.
  Hard for them to realize that it's wrong for most people.
  #GoogleCSFirst
</blockquote>
<p>
  Separately,
  on <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2013/12/18/to-get-interest-catch-and-hold-attention/">his blog</a>,
  he cited John Dewey:
</p>
<blockquote>
  ...interest operates by a process of "catch" and "hold"&mdash;first
  the individual's interest must be captured,
  and then it must be maintained.
</blockquote>
<p>
  and added:
</p>
<blockquote>
  We know more about how to retain students these days...consider
  the <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2013/08/05/success-in-introductory-programming-what-works/">UCSD results</a>
  and the <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2013/08/09/in-remembrance-of-mediacomp-past-icer-2013-preview/">MediaComp results</a>.
  But...we are particularly bad at catching the attention of women and minority students.
  Our enrollment numbers are rising,
  but <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2013/10/26/acm-ndc-report-confirms-growth-in-graduates-with-computing-skills/">the percentage of
    women and under-represented minorities is not</a>.

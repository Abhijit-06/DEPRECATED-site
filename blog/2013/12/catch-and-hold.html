<p>
  I'm a big fan of <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com">Mark Guzdial</a>'s work
  on computing education.
  Last week,
  he <a href="https://twitter.com/guzdial/status/413374893141413888">tweeted</a> this:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Google is made of people who succeed in current CS teaching model.
  Hard for them to realize that it's wrong for most people.
  #GoogleCSFirst
</blockquote>

  Separately,
  on <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2013/12/18/to-get-interest-catch-and-hold-attention/">his blog</a>,
  he cited John Dewey:
</p>
<blockquote>
  ...interest operates by a process of "catch" and "hold"&mdash;first
  the individual's interest must be captured,
  and then it must be maintained.
</blockquote>

  I've been thinking about both points a fair bit
  while making plans for the new year.
  The people who are most active in Software Carpentry,
  myself included,
  are not typical of most scientists,
  so it's often hard for us to think outside our own heads
  about what will attract regular scientists' interest
  and hold it long enough to stick.
  The twin gospels of open science and reproducibility aren't effective:
  in my experience,
  people who are swayed by those arguments are already on our side
  or on their way there.
  Productivity and empowerment seem to be more compelling,
  but come the new year,
  we need to dig into this and find out why people are coming to our bootcamps
  and what they're actually taking away.

  Further down in that same blog post,
  Guzdial said something else that I've been thinking about:
</p>
<blockquote>
  We know more about how to retain students these days...consider
  the <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2013/08/05/success-in-introductory-programming-what-works/">UCSD results</a>
  and the <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2013/08/09/in-remembrance-of-mediacomp-past-icer-2013-preview/">MediaComp results</a>.
  But...we are particularly bad at catching the attention of women and minority students.
  Our enrollment numbers are rising,
  but <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2013/10/26/acm-ndc-report-confirms-growth-in-graduates-with-computing-skills/">the percentage of women and under-represented minorities is not</a>.
</blockquote>
<p>
  We've made progress with respect to gender balance
  (even outwith our
  <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2013/07/wise-roundup.html">WiSE</a>
  <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2013/11/wise-bootcamp-at-lbl.html">bootcamps</a>),
  but not with under-represented minorities,
  with smaller, poorer, and more remote schools,
  or with developing countries.
  We'll be trying to reach out to all three in the new year,
  and would appreciate any introductions our readers or alumni can make.

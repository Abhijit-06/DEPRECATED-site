<p>
  <em>I'm going to be teaching my first ever bootcamp in the coming days. My biggest fear
  (and there are many!) is that the participants will walk out of the room on the final
  afternoon and go straight back to their old habits, never taking the time to incorporate
  what they've learned into their daily workflow. In an attempt to avoid this eventuality,
  I've planned a rousing concluding address to explain why the content taught at a
  Software Carpentry bootcamp is so important. It goes something like this...</em>

<!-- end excerpt -->

<p>Here's a research workflow that we are all familiar with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A scientist collects some data and stores it on a machine that is occasionally 
    backed up by her department.
  </li>
  <li>
    She then writes or modifies a few small programs (which also reside on her machine) 
    to analyse that data, with assistance from Google/Stack Exchange and a helpful 
    colleague.
  </li> 
  <li>
    Once she has some results that look right (which alleviates her fear that there 
    might be bugs in her code), she writes them up and submits her paper. She might 
    include her data---a growing number of journals require this---but she probably 
    doesn't include her code.
  </li>
  <li>
    Time passes.
  </li>
  <li>
    The journal sends her reviews written anonymously by a handful of other people in 
    her field. She revises her paper to satisfy them, during which time she might also 
    modify the scripts she wrote earlier, and resubmits.
  </li>
  <li>
    More time passes.
  </li>
  <li>
    The paper is eventually published. It might include a link to an online copy of her 
    data, but the paper itself will be behind a paywall: only people who have personal 
    or institutional access will be able to read it.
  </li>
</ul>

  If you read any research related blogs or scan the editorial sections of prominent 
  journals like <em>Nature</em> or <em>Science</em>, you'll know that "open" and "web" are 
  two of the major buzz words right now. In essence, this is because there are now a whole 
  range of web based tools out there that make it possible for this workflow to be more 
  collaborative, transparent, reproducible and reliable than ever before. All scientists 
  would agree that these are much needed improvements, but most lack the requisite 
  computing skills to fully participate in this "open science" revolution. It is for 
  precisely this reason that the 
  <a href="http://mozillascience.org/" target="_blank"> Mozilla Science Lab</a> - whose 
  mission is to help researchers use the open web to shape scienceâ€™s future - is now the 
  organisational home for 
  <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/" target="_blank">Software Carpentry</a>. They 
  recognise that in order for these tools and practices to make it out of buzz word 
  editorials and into the default workflow of everyday scientists, the entire profession 
  needs to upskill. Graduates of a two-day Software Carpentry bootcamp, whether they 
  immediately realise it or not, have all the basic skills and knowledge necessary to 
  transition to a research workflow that looks something more like this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The data that the scientist collects is stored in an open access repository like 
    <a href="http://figshare.com/" target="_blank">figshare</a> or 
    <a href="http://datadryad.org/" target="_blank">Dryad</a> as soon 
    as it's collected, and given its own DOI.
  </li>
  <li>
    The scientist creates a new repository on 
    <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to hold her work.
  </li>
  <li>
    As she does her analysis, she pushes changes to her scripts (and possibly some 
    output files) to that repository. She also uses the repository for her paper; 
    that repository is then the hub for collaboration with her colleagues.
  </li>
  <li>
    She regularly attends her nearest 
    <a href="http://conference.scipy.org/index.html" target="_blank">SciPy conference</a> 
    and is on the mailing lists of her favourite Python packages, which means she has a 
    large support network. She is also using 
    <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0530" target="_blank">best practices</a> like 
    <a href="http://drclimate.wordpress.com/2013/10/10/testing-your-code/" target="_blank">unit testing</a> 
    and defensive programming, which gives her confidence that her results are reliable.
  </li>
  <li>
    When she's happy with the state of her paper, she posts a version to 
    <a href="http://arxiv.org/" target="_blank">arXiv</a> or some other preprint server to
    invite feedback from peers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Based on that feedback, she may post several revisions before finally submitting 
    her paper to a journal.
  </li>
  <li>
    The published paper includes links to her preprint and to her code and data 
    repositories, which makes it much easier for other scientists to use her work as 
    starting point for their own research.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Wouldn't the world be a better place if this were the norm!</p>

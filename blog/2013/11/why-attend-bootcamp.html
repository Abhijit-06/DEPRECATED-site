<p>
  <em>I'm going to be teaching my first ever bootcamp in the coming days. My biggest fear
  (and there are many!) is that the participants will walk out of the room on the final
  afternoon and go straight back to their old habits, never taking the time to incorporate
  what they've learned into their daily workflow. In an attempt to avoid this eventuality,
  I've planned a rousing concluding address to explain why the content taught at a
  Software Carpentry bootcamp is so important. It goes something like this...</em>

<!-- end excerpt -->

<p>Consider the workflow of Nigel Nobootcamp, which is typical of many researchers today:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Nigel collects some data and stores it on a machine that is occasionally 
    backed up by his department.
  </li>
  <li>
    He then writes or modifies a few small programs (which also reside on his machine) 
    to analyse that data, with assistance from Google/Stack Exchange and a helpful 
    colleague.
  </li> 
  <li>
    Once he has some results that look right (which alleviates his fear that there 
    might be bugs in his code), he writes them up and submits the paper. He 
    includes his data---a growing number of journals require this---but doesn't include 
    his code.
  </li>
  <li>
    Time passes.
  </li>
  <li>
    The journal sends him reviews written anonymously by a handful of other people in 
    his field. He revises the paper to satisfy them, during which time he also 
    modifies the scripts he wrote earlier, and resubmits.
  </li>
  <li>
    More time passes.
  </li>
  <li>
    The paper is eventually published. It includes a link to an online copy of his 
    data, but the paper itself is behind a paywall: only people who have personal 
    or institutional access are able to read it.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you read any research related blogs or scan the editorial sections of prominent 
  journals like <em>Nature</em> or <em>Science</em>, you'll know that "open" and "web" are 
  two of the major buzz words right now. In essence, this is because there are now a whole 
  range of web based tools out there that make it possible for this typical workflow to be far more 
  collaborative, transparent, reproducible and reliable. All scientists would agree that 
  these are desirable improvements, but most lack the requisite computing skills to 
  fully participate in this "open science" revolution. It is for precisely this reason 
  that the <a href="http://mozillascience.org/" target="_blank"> Mozilla Science Lab</a> 
  - whose mission is to help researchers use the open web to shape scienceâ€™s future - is 
  now the organisational home for Software Carpentry. They recognise that in order for 
  these tools and practices to make it out of buzz word editorials and into the default 
  workflow of everyday scientists like Nigel, the entire profession needs to upskill. 
  Graduates of a two-day Software Carpentry bootcamp, whether they immediately realise it 
  or not, have all the basic skills and knowledge to transition to a workflow 
  that looks something more like this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The data that Betty Bootcamp collects is stored in an open access repository called 
    <a href="http://datadryad.org/" target="_blank">Dryad</a> as soon 
    as it's collected, and given its own DOI.
  </li>
  <li>
    She creates a new version control repository on 
    <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to hold her work.
  </li>
  <li>
    As she does her analysis, she pushes changes to her scripts (and some 
    output files) to that repository. She also uses the repository for her paper; 
    that repository is then the hub for collaboration with her colleagues.
  </li>
  <li>
    With respect to scripting, she regularly attends her nearest 
    <a href="http://conference.scipy.org/index.html" target="_blank">SciPy conference</a> 
    and is on the mailing lists of her favourite data analysis packages. She is also using 
    <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0530" target="_blank">best practices</a> like 
    <a href="http://drclimate.wordpress.com/2013/10/10/testing-your-code/" target="_blank">unit testing</a> 
    and defensive programming, which gives her confidence that her results are reliable.
  </li>
  <li>
    When she's happy with the state of her paper, she posts a version to a preprint server
    called <a href="http://arxiv.org/" target="_blank">arXiv</a> to invite feedback from 
    peers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Based on that feedback, she posts several revisions before finally submitting 
    her paper to a journal.
  </li>
  <li>
    The published paper includes links to her preprint and to her code and data 
    repositories.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  At an individual level, it's obvious that Betty's workflow would probably produce higher 
  quality research. Her use of unit testing (as opposed to Nigel's "looks right" approach) 
  has reduced the chance of errors, while the ease with which others could collaborate 
  (GitHub) and provide commentary (arXiv) on her work means it's likely to have been 
  exposed to a higher level of scrutiny prior to journal submission. The data 
  analysis process was probably also far less painful for Betty. Aside from the best 
  practices she learned to make her code more readable and easy to manage, her previous
  bootcamp experience has given her the confidence to interact with the
  programming community (SciPy, mailing lists). When she runs into trouble while 
  programming (which still happens regularly), she now has a large support network to 
  turn to.    
</p>
<p>
  At a broader community level, it is important to note that Betty's research is far more
  transparent. If other researchers want to reproduce and ultimately build on her work, 
  they have open access to a description of her methodology (arXiv), her data 
  (Dryad) and her code (GitHub). This will surely accelerate the discovery process in her 
  field of research, and is probably pretty good for her citation statistics too!

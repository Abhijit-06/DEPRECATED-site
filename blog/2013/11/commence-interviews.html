<!-- start excerpt -->
<p> You might remember Software Carpentry would like to quantify realistic impact after the &quot;dust settles&quot; from a bootcamp.
That is, after three months has passed, how has Software Carpentry improved a scientist's workflow?
Recent accomplishments toward this understanding include obtaining Internal Review Board for Human Subjects Research (IRB) approval through Michigan State University and beginning to recruit volunteers for interviewing at the three month mark.</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<p>Why is IRB approval important?
The Internal Review Board process helps us ensure safety, transparency, and accountability for research projects involving people.
Even the best-intentioned researcher may unintentionally place subjects in an emotional or physical danger. This review process ensures no one falls through the safety gaps.</p>

<p>This week we were able to begin recruiting previous attendees for interviews.
At the current rate we are recruiting 4 out of 100+ attendees emailed.
I would like to increase this rate, but am unsure how to do this.
If anyone has suggests then I would really like to hear them.</p>
<p> Being that IRB requirements are very particular about how participants are contacted, I can't dress up the initial poll for participation beyond what is written in the usual IRB format consent message (see below).
Unfortunately, this means only the dedicated (or bored?) post-bootcamp attendee will understand what we are asking, let alone consider participating in the study.
My original version had more of an Executive Summary approach because we all know a wall of text is a barrier to entry.
But again the IRB office insisted on a format consistent with standard consent form.</p>
	<p> This is a good opportunity to list for posterty some lessons learned or strategies that worked well:</p>
	<h3>Say Hello to the IRB</h3>
	<p>Unless you have the super power to intuit the rules for all required forms, it is helpful to pay an office visit to the people who work with those IRB forms on a daily basis.
	With questions and forms in hand they will help you save a lot of time.
  	In my case I used the telephone quite a bit, but face to face help would have been even more efficient.</p>
	<h3> Microsoft Word</h3>
	<p>This one caught me off guard.
	Depending on the state of technological advancement and workflows of your local IRB office, you may need to find a computer with Microsoft Word in order to complete required forms in a manner most agreeable for submission.
  	My own experience in this process showed me LibreOffice is not yet a viable substitute in some situations.</p>
	<h3> Plan for Change</h3>
	<p>Changing any part of your study -- even just the consent message -- is time-consuming and requires formal validation.
  	It's better to write in possibilities now rather than have to officially alter to achieve those later.</p>
	<p>Below is the official Consent Email.</p>

	<p>Informed Consent Email sent to participants.</p>
	<p> Research project title: Software Carpentry Bootcamp Impact<br>
	Principal Investigator: [redacted]</p>

	<h3> 1. Explanation of the Research and What You Will Do:</h3>
	<p>You are being asked to participate in a research study about the Softawre Carpentry Botocamp you recently attended.
	Researchers at Michigan State University are interested in understanding the  magnitude of benefit participants gained from their experience at a Software Carpentry Bootcamp, as well as specific areas the Bootcamps may be improved Researchers would like to analyze skills and practices common to computation in science to draw conclusions about Software Carpentry Bootcamp effectiveness and improvement.
	These results would be included in research reports, presentations, or publications and the anonymous data may be made publicly available.
	Identifiable information such as name or professional position will not be recorded.
	You must be at least 18 years old to participate in this research study.
	If you are interested, then we would like to interview subjects by phone or other audio means and record your responses by transcription.
	The interview should take about 20 minutes.
  	You may also be asked for a second interview 6 months later to see if and how your workflows have changed.</p>

	<h3> 2. Your Rights to Participate, Say No, or Withdraw:</h3>
	<p>Participation in this research project is completely voluntary.
	You have the right to say no.
	You may change your mind at any time and withdraw.
	You may choose to not answer specific questions or to stop participating at any time.
  	Whether you choose to participate or not will have no effect on your grade or evaluation at the bootcamp or any future bootcamps.</p>

	<h3> 3. Costs and Compensation for Being in the Study:</h3>
	<p> There are no costs or compensation offered to participate.</p>

	<h3> 4. Contact Information for Questions and Concerns:</h3>
	<p> If you have questions or would like further information about this study, then please contact Jorden Schossau at jory@msu.
	edu or The Michigan State University's Human Research Protection Program  at 517-355-2180, Fax 517-432-4503, or e-mail irb@msu.edu or regular mail at 408 W. Circle Drive, 207 Olds Hall, MSU, East Lansing, MI 48824.</p>
	<p> If you consent to participating in an interview about your computational use patterns and experience at a previous Software Carpentry Bootcamp then please reply to this email and we'll work out a time and method for interview that is easiest for you. By emailing a response, you voluntarily agree to participate in this study.</p>

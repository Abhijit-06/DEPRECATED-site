<p>
  Marian Petre and I have written a report on
  the pilot study of scientific code review
  done jointly by PLOS and Mozilla,
  which is now <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2412">on arXiv</a>.
  Our thanks to everyone who participated;
  we hope to be able to do a longer and more in-depth pilot early in 2014.

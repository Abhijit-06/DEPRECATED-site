<p>
  Our next online lab meeting will take place at 11:00 am and 7:00 pm Eastern time on Thursday, November 14.
  (As always, we'll run it meeting twice to accommodate different time zones.)
  The meeting will be combined with the first one for the Mozilla Science Lab;
  we're growing an agenda on <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-labmeeting">this Etherpad</a>,
  and call-in details are there as well.
  We look forward to seeing you then!

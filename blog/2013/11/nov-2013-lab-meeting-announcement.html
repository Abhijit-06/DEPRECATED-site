<p>
  Our next online lab meeting will take place right after the Mozilla Science Lab meeting,
  which starts at 11:00 am pm Eastern time on Thursday, November 14.
  (As always, we'll run our meeting again at 7:00 pm on the same day to accommodate different time zones.)
  The meeting will be combined with the first one for the Mozilla Science Lab;
  its agenda and connection details will be on <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/sciencelab-calls-nov14">this Etherpad</a>,
  and ours on <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/swc-labmeeting">this one</a>.
  We look forward to seeing you then!

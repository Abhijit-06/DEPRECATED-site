<p>
Since we announce
<a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/10/call-for-instructor-training.html">that the applications for December Instructor Training</a>
we receive a lot of questions. We amend the announcement with the answer to some
questions and we believe that others need a post dedicated to them.

<p>
We are been excited to see the strong interest in this program
and the enthusiasm for getting even larger groups together for this training.
Due to this interest we wanted to provide some updates.
</p>
<p>
First, this program is a pilot for delivering
training to groups at a larger scale.
We should have make this more clear when we first announced
<a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/09/rebooting-instructor-training.html">the instructor training reboot</a>
and we are sorry about that.
This pilot
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
        Satisfies pent-up demand for IT in our community.
        </p>
        <p>
        We've made commitments to Partners and Affiliates to provide training
        and help build communities of instructors at their institutions
        <strong>but we also want to do this effectively</strong>
        so we will ask you to be a little more patient if you are not selected for this round.
        If you have questions, <a href="mailto:execdir@software-carpentry.org">Jonah</a> will be happy to answer them.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Allows us to compare two different approaches to open online training
        and get a handle on their true costs.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Allows us to see what effect the requirement for preparatory work has
        on completion and follow-through rates.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Provides practical training for new trainers.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Provides raw material that those new trainers can turn into reusable
        IT curriculum.

Some points of clarification from
<a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/10/call-for-instructor-training.html">FAQs</a>:
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Group consideration:</strong>
        For this pilot,
        we will continue to consider all groups equally,
        so we know how this format works for different organizations.
        <strong>
            In the next round of instructor training,
            Partners and Affiliates will be prioritized,
            and based on the outcome and effectiveness of this approach,
            it will be delivered either as an individual online version or in this group format.
        </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Group size restrictions:</strong>
        <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/09/rebooting-instructor-training.html">At first we said</a>
        "we will invite groups of 4-6 people to take part in the two-day training course in December 2015"
        and
        <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2015/10/call-for-instructor-training.html">later</a>
        we drop the size of the groups because enforcing a minimum size will exclude many people.
        Some people contacted us asking if large groups (with more than 10 people)
        and we didn't anticipate that such large groups would be interested in this format
        until asked if it will be allowed.
        <strong>
            We will be capping the number of participants from each organization at 10.
            If you have more than 5 people,
            you will need to commit to running two workshops,
            so all participants have a chance to be an instructor
            that was the initial plan.
        </strong>
    </li>
</ul>

We look forward to the opportunity to run this training,
and welcome your feedback along the way!

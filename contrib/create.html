  <h2>New Lessons and Examples</h2>

  <p>
    We welcome new lessons,
    particularly extended examples that show how the things we teach fit together.
    For an example,
    take a look at the <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/invperc/">invasion percolation example</a>,
    which covers topics as diverse as restructuring code to make it more testable,
    performance profiling,
    and the advantages of lazy data structures.
    Such examples can be specific to different research disciplines,
    which often makes them the most convincing part of our bootcamp.

  <h2>Related Projects</h2>

  <p>
    We teach using many people's tools,
    and contributions to those will always help us.
    In particular:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="http://github.com/jiffyclub/ipythonblocks">ipythonblocks</a>
      and
      <a href="http://github.com/synesthesiam/novice">skimage.novice</a>
      have let us adopt a media-first approach to teaching programming.
      Enhancements to either of these are very welcome.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://github.com/wolever/browsercast">BrowserCast</a> will,
      when finished,
      allow us to replay an IPython Notebook in sync with a voiceover&mdash;in other words,
      to use the Notebook for screencasting
      <em>without</em> the large file sizes
      and loss of first-class content
      that plague current screencasting options.
    </li>
    <li>
      There are lots of plugins for the <a href="http://ipython.org">IPython Notebook</a>
      that would make our job easier.
      We'd particularly like something like <a href="http://regexpal.com">Regex Pal</a>
      for teaching regular expressions
      and an embedded vector drawing widget for doing diagrams.
      If you're interested in working with a great bunch of developers
      on a tool that's changing the way scientists work every day,
      please <a href="mailto::{{site.contact}}">get in touch.
